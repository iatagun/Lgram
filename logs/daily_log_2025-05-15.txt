Corrected Text:
Please proofread the following text, fixing any issues with clarity, continuity, grammar, and punctuation: ==== The crime was committed by an old man. Indeed, so bad is the weather that we sometimes talk about the reason why he was in Berlin and the city itself. The reason is that he is a rich man. Grass has not grown in this day and age, so it is not suitable for making friends or building communities. I find myself in a bar and ask for a drink when I see a new world around me.
