What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, although puzzling questions, are not beyond all conjecture. Sir Thomas Browne The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are in themselves, but little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their effects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest enjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the analyst in that moral activity which disentangles.
He derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He is fond of enigmas, of conundrums, hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of acumen which appears to the ordinary apprehension preternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul and essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition. The faculty of resolution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyze.
A chess-player, for example, does the one, without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the elaborate frivolity of chess.
In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex, is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed, resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold, but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten, it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers.
In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract, let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometimes indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.
Whist has long been known for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing chess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in Christendom may be little more than the best player of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all these more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived.
These are not only manifold, but multiform, and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and, so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a retentive memory, and proceed by "the book," are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing.
But it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced.
He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of what to observe.
Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the game. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes every variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or chagrin. From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit.
He recognizes what is played through feint, by the manner with which it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness, or trepidation all afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two or three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own. The analytical power should not be confounded with simple ingenuity; for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis.
The constructive or combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous. It will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the truly imaginative never otherwise than analytic. The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.
Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18 , I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young gentleman was of an excellent, indeed of an illustrious family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes. By courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without troubling himself about its superfluities.
Books, indeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained. Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other again and again.
I was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is the theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination. Seeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I frankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain. Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we should have been regarded as madmen although, perhaps, as madmen of a harmless nature.
Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors. Indeed, the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in Paris, We existed within ourselves alone.
It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to be enamored of the night for her own sake; and into this bizarrerie, as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon. The sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the massy shutters of our old building; lighted a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays, By the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams reading, writing, or conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness.
Then we sallied forth into the streets, arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford. At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic ability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its exercise if not exactly in its display and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments was frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded petulant but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the enunciation.
Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin the creative and the resolvent. Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing any mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the Frenchman was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased, intelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the idea.
We were strolling one night down a long dirty street, in the vicinity of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words:  "He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for the Theatre Variétés." "There can be no doubt of that," I replied, unwittingly, and not at first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was profound.
"Dupin," said I, gravely, "this is beyond my comprehension. I do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How was it possible you should know that I was thinking of ? " Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought. " of Chantilly," said he, "why do you pause?
You were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy. " This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections. Chantilly was a quondam cobbler of the Rue St. Dennis, who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the rôle of Xerxes, in Crébillon's tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains. "Tell me, for Heaven's sake," I exclaimed, "the method if method there is by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter."
In fact, I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express. "It was the fruiterer," replied my friend, "who brought you to the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for Xerxes et id genus omne."
"The fruiterer! you astonish me I know no fruiterer whomsoever." "The man who ran up against you as we entered the street it may have been fifteen minutes ago."
I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we passed from the Rue C into the thoroughfare where we stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand. There was not a particle of charlatânerie about Dupin. "I will explain," he said, "and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which I spoke to you until that of the recontre with the fruiterer in question. The larger links of the chain run thus Chantilly, Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer."
There are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of interest; and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the starting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement, when I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth.
He continued:  "We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before leaving the Rue C. This was the last subject we discussed. As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving-stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped upon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to what you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of necessity. "You kept your eyes upon the ground glancing, with a petulant expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement (so that I saw you were still thinking of the stones), until we reached the little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks.
Here your countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the word 'stereotomy,' a term very affectedly applied to this species of pavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself 'stereotomy' without being brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great nebula in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do so. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed your steps. But in that bitter tirade upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's 'Musée,' the satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler's change of name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed.
I mean the line  Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum. I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I was aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly. That you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips.
You thought of the poor cobbler's immolation. So far, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your meditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little fellow that Chantilly he would do better at the Théâtre des Variétés.
" Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the "Gazette des Tribunaux," when the following paragraphs arrested our attention. "Extraordinary Murder.
This morning, about three o'clock, the inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were roused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of one Madame L'Espanaye, and her daughter, Mademoiselle Camille L'Espanaye. After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered, accompanied by two gendarmes. By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices, in angry contention, were distinguished, and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house. As the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased, and everything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves, and hurried from room to room.
Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story (the door of which, being found locked; with the key inside, was forced open), a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment. "The apartment was in the wildest disorder the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor. On a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood.
On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of gray human hair, also dabbled with blood, and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were found four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three smaller of metal d'Alger, and two bags, containing nearly four thousand francs in gold. The drawers of a bureau, which stood in one corner, were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many articles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under the bed (not under the bedstead).
It was open, with the key still in the door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence. "Of Madame L'Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fireplace, a search was made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance.
The body was quite warm. Upon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon the face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.
"After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house without further discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell off. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity. "To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest clue."
The next day's paper had these additional particulars:  "The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue. Many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair" [the word "affaire" has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys with us], "but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it.
We give below all the material testimony elicited. "Pauline Dubourg, laundress, deposes that she has known both the deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period. The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms very affectionate toward each other.
They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard to their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any person in the house when she called for the clothes or took them home.
Was sure that they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story. "Pierre Moreau, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L'Espanaye for nearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided there.
The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the corpses were found for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by a jeweler, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house was the property of Madame L.  She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any portion.
The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter some five or six times during the six years. The two lived an exceedingly retired life were reputed to have money.
Had heard it said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes did not believe it. Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten times.
"Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one was spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there were any living connections of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters of the front windows were seldom opened.
Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The house was a good house not very old. "Isidore Muset, gendarme, deposes that he was called to the house about three o'clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom nor top.
The shrieks were continued until the gate was forced and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams of some person (or persons) in great agony were loud and drawn out, not short and quick. Witness led the way upstairs. Upon reaching the first landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention the one a gruff voice, the other much shriller a very strange voice. Could distinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman.
Was positive that it was not a woman's voice. Could distinguish the words 'sacre' and 'diable.' The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.
Could not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman.
Could not make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we described them yesterday. "Henri Duval, a neighbor, and by trade a silversmith, deposes that he was one of the party who first entered the house.
Corroborates the testimony of Muset in general.
As soon as they forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French.
Could not be sure that it was a man's voice.
It might have been a woman's.
Was not acquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian. Knew Madame L. and her daughter.
Had conversed with both frequently. Was sure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased. " Odenheimer, restaurateur.
This witness volunteered his testimony. Not speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of Amsterdam.
Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted for several minutes probably ten. They were long and loud very awful and distressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated the previous evidence in every respect but one.
Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a man of a Frenchman.  Could not distinguish the words uttered.
They were loud and quick unequal spoken apparently in fear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh not so much shrill as harsh.
Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly, 'sacre,' 'diable,' and once 'mon Dieu.'  "Jules Mignaud, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine.  Is the elder Mignaud.
Madame L'Espanaye had some property.  Had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year (eight years previously). Made frequent deposits in small sums.
Had checked for nothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4,000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk sent home with the money. "Adolphe Le Bon, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L'Espanaye to her residence with the 4,000 francs, put up in two bags.
Upon the door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did not see any person in the street at the time. It is a by-street very lonely.
"William Bird, tailor, deposes that he was one of the party who entered the house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years.
Was one of the first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.  Could make out several words, but can not now remember all. Heard distinctly 'sacre' and 'mon Dieu.' There was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling a scraping and scuffling sound.
The shrill voice was very loud louder than the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman. Appeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman's voice.
Does not understand German. "Four of the above-named witnesses being recalled, deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it. Everything was perfectly silent no groans or noises of any kind.
Upon forcing the door no person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was closed but not locked.
The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the front of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage, was open, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth. These were carefully removed and searched.
There was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four-story one, with garrets (mansardes). A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely did not appear to have been opened for years.
The time elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the room door was variously stated by the witnesses. Some made it as short as three minutes some as long as five. The door was opened with difficulty.
"Alfonzo Garco, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue Morgue. Is a native of Spain.
Was one of the party who entered the house. Did not proceed upstairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of the consequences of agitation.
Heard the voices in contention. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.  Could not distinguish what was said. The shrill voice was that of an Englishman is sure of this.
Does not understand the English language, but judges by the intonation. "Alfonzo Garcio, undertaker, deposes that he was among the first to ascend the stairs.
Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words.
The speaker appeared to be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice. Spoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian.
Corroborates the general testimony.
Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of Russia. "Several witness, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being.
By 'sweeps,' were meant cylindrical sweeping-brushes, such as are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded upstairs. The body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength.
"Paul Dumas, physician, deposes that he was called to view the bodies about daybreak. They were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances.
The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep scratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the eyeballs protruded.
The tongue had been partially bitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion of M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or persons unknown.
The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered. The left tibia much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side.
Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of wood, or a broad bar of iron a chair any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon.
The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument probably with a razor. "Alexandre Etienne, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the bodies.
Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.
"Nothing further of importance was elicited, although several other persons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris if indeed a murder has been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow of a clue apparent. " The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the Quartier St. Roch that the premises in question had been carefully researched, and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose.
A postscript, however, mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned although nothing appeared to criminate him beyond the facts already detailed. Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders. I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble mystery.
I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer. "We must not judge of the means," said Dupin, "by this shell of an examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for acumen, are cunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond the method of the moment.
They make a vast parade of measures; but, not infrequently, these are so ill-adapted to the objects proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain's calling for his robe-de-chambre pour mieux entendre la musique. The results attained by them are not infrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good guesser, and a persevering man.
But, without educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity at his investigations.
He impaired his vision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in a well.
In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial. The depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of error are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies. To look at a star by glances to view it in a sidelong way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly is to have the best appreciation of its lustre a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it.
A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case, but in the former, there is the more refined capacity for comprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmament by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct. "As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us amusement" [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said nothing], "and besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I am not ungrateful.
We will go and see the premises with our own eyes. I know G, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission. " The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue. This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch.
It was late in the afternoon when we reached it, as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window, indicating a loge de concierge. Before going in we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the rear of the building Dupin, meanwhile, examining the whole neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for which I could see no possible object.
Retracing our steps we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents in charge. We went upstairs into the chamber where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the "Gazette des Tribunaux."
Dupin scrutinized everything not excepting the bodies of the victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a gendarme accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until dark, when we took our departure.
On our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers. I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that Je les menagais: for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder, until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had observed anything peculiar at the scene of the atrocity. There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word "peculiar," which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.
"No, nothing peculiar," I said; "nothing more, at least, than we both saw stated in the paper." "The 'Gazette'," he replied, "has not entered, I fear, into the unusual horror of the thing.
But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution I mean for the outre character of its features. The police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive not for the murder itself but for the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with the facts that no one was discovered upstairs but the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending.
The wild disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted acumen, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search for the true.
In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred?' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?' In fact, the facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police." I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment. "I am now awaiting," continued he, looking toward the door of our apartment "I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure implicated in their perpetration.
Of the worst portion of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the entire riddle. I look for the man here in this room every moment. It is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.
Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use." I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times.
His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall. "That the voices heard in contention," he said, "by the party upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved by the evidence.
This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter, and afterward have committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely precludes the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention.
Let me now advert not to the whole testimony respecting these voices but to what was peculiar in that testimony. Did you observe anything peculiar about it?" I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.
"That was the evidence itself," said Dupin, "but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive. Yet there was something to be observed.
The witnesses, as you remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is not that they disagreed but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner.
Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen. Each likens it not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant but the converse. The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the Spanish.' The Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that 'not understanding French this witness was examined through an interpreter.' The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and 'does not understand German.' The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, 'as he has no knowledge of the English.' The Italian believes it the voice of a Russian, but 'has never conversed with a native of Russia.' A second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the voice was that of an Italian; but, not being cognizant of that tongue, is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation.' Now, how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as this could have been elicited!
in whose tones, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognize nothing familiar! You will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic of an African. Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points. The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than shrill.' It is represented by two others to have been 'quick and unequal.' No words no sounds resembling words were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable. "I know not," continued Dupin, "what impression I may have made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all further progress in the investigation of the mystery.
I said 'legitimate deductions'; but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones, and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result. What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form a certain tendency to my inquiries in the chamber.
"Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is not too much to say that neither of us believes in preternatural events.
Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The doers of the deed were material and escaped materially. Then how?  Fortunately there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that mode must lead us to a definite decision. Let us examine, each by each, the possible means of egress.
It is clear that the assassins were in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is, then, only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid bare the floors, the ceiling, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction.
No secret issues could have escaped their vigilance. But, not trusting to their eyes, I examined with my own.
There were, then, no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys.
These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.
The murderers must have passed, then, through those of the back room. Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent 'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such. "There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by furniture, and is wholly visible.
The lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within. It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash failed also.
The police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And, therefore, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows. "My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the reason I have just given because here it was, I knew, that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality. "I proceeded to think thus a posteriori.
The murderers did escape from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened; the consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes were fastened.
They must, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty, and attempted to raise the sash. It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated.
A concealed spring must, I now knew, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises, at least, were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.
"I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would have caught but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The assassins must have escaped through the other window.
Supposing, then, the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there must be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring, which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor.
I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently fitted in the same manner driven in nearly up to the head. "You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase, I had not been once 'at fault.' The scent had never for an instant been lost.
There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the secret to its ultimate result and that result was the nail. It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive as it might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this point, teminated the clue. ' There must be something wrong,' I said, 'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in the gimlet-hole, where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially embedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete the fissure was invisible.
Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed. I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect. "This riddle, so far, was now unriddled.
The assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail further inquiry being thus considered unnecessary. "The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.
From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters ferrades a kind rarely employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux. They are in the form of an ordinary door (a single, not a folding door), except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis thus affording an excellent hold for the hands.
In the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from the rear of the house, they were both about half open that is to say, they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at these ferrades in the line of their breadth (as they must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination. It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod.
It was also evident that, by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected. By reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the trellis-work.
Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room. "I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing might possibly have been accomplished: but, secondly and chiefly, I wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary the almost preternatural character of that agility which could have accomplished it. "You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that 'to make out my case,' I should rather undervalue than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter.
This may be the practise in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object is only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in juxtaposition, that very unusual activity of which I have just spoken, with that very peculiar shrill (or harsh) and unequal voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be detected." At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning of Dupin flitted over my mind.
I seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension, without power to comprehend as men, at times, find themselves upon the brink of remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. My friend went on with his discourse. "You will see," he said, "that I have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same point.
Let us now revert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here. The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is absurd. It is a mere guess a very silly one and no more.
How are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained? Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life saw no company seldom went out had little use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a thief had taken any, why did he not take the best why did he not take all?
In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to encumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold was abandoned. Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice.
Coincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In the present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence. It would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.
"Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your attention that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this let us glance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney head downward. Ordinary assassins employ no such mode of murder as this.
Least of all do they thus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit that there was something excessively outre something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men. Think, too, how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down!
"Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvelous. On the hearth were thick tresses very thick tresses of gray human hair.
These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself.
Their roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of the old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body of Madame L'Espanaye I do not speak.
Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This idea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them because, by the affair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.
"If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a grotesquerie in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I made upon your fancy? " I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question.
"A madman," I said, "has done this deed some raving maniac, escaped from a neighboring Maison de Santé."  "In some respects," he replied, "your idea is not irrelevant. But the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs.
Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L'Espanaye.
Tell me what you can make of it." "Dupin!"
I said, completely unnerved; "this hair is most unusual this is no human hair." "I have not asserted that it is," said he; "but, before we decide this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon this paper.
It is a facsimile drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises and deep indentations of finger nails' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in another (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne) as a 'series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.' "You will perceive," continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon the table before us, "that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold. There is no slipping apparent. Each finger has retained possibly until the death of the victim the fearful grasp by which it originally embedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see them.
" I made the attempt in vain. "We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial," he said. "The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which is about that of the throat.
Wrap the drawing around it, and try the experiment again. " I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. "This," I said, "is the mark of no human hand. " "Read now," replied Dupin, "this passage from Cuvier."
It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous Orang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.
"The description of the digits," said I, as I made an end of the reading, "is in exact accordance with his drawing. I see that no animal but an Orang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery.
Besides, there were two voices heard in contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman." "True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice the expression, 'mon Dieu!' This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation.
Upon these two words, therefore, I have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman was cognizant of the murder. It is possible indeed it is far more than probable that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place. The Orang-Outang may have escaped from him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have recaptured it.
It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses for I have no right to call them more since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another. We will call them guesses, then, and speak of them as such.
If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement, which I left last night, upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde' (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors), will bring him to our residence." He handed me a paper, and I read thus:   "CAUGHT In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the  inst.
(the morning of the murder), a very large, tawny Orang-Outang of the Bornese species. The owner (who is ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel) may have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping.
Call at No.  Rue , Faubourg St. Germain au troisieme." "How was it possible," I asked, "that you should know the man to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?"
"I do not know it," said Dupin. "I am not sure of it. Here, however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long queues of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie, and it is peculiar to the Maltese.
I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained.
Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement about demanding the Orang-Outang. He will reason thus: 'I am innocent; I am poor; my Orang-Outang is of great value to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself why should I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my grasp.
It was found in the Bois de Boulogne at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed? The police are at fault they have failed to procure the slightest clue.
Should they even trace the animal, it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, I am known. The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast.
I am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I possess, it will render the animal at least liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the advertisement, get the Orang-Outang, and keep it close until this matter has blown over.
" At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs. "Be ready," said Dupin, "with your pistols, but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself." The front door of the house had been left open, and the visitor had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase. Now, however, he seemed to hesitate.
Presently we heard him descending. Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up. He did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber. "Come in," said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone. A man entered.
He was a sailor, evidently a tall, stout, and muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburned, was more than half-hidden by whisker and mustachio. He had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed awkwardly, and bade us "good-evening," in French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin. "Sit down, my friend," said Dupin.
"I suppose you have called about the Orang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you suppose him to be?"
The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:  "I have no way of telling but he can't be more than four or five years old. Have you got him here?"
"Oh, no; we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by.
You can get him in the morning. Of course you are prepared to identify the property?" "To be sure I am, sir."
"I shall be sorry to part with him," said Dupin. "I don't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir," said the man.
"Couldn't expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal that is to say, anything in reason. " "Well," replied my friend, "that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me think!
what should I have? Oh!
I will tell you. My reward shall be this.
You shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue." Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly.
Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it, and put the key in his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without the least flurry, upon the table. The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.
He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel; but the next moment he fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance of death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my heart. "My friend," said Dupin, in a kind tone, "you are alarming yourself unnecessarily you are, indeed.
We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue.
It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of information about this matter means of which you could never have dreamed. Now, the thing stands thus. You have done nothing which you could have avoided nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with impunity.
You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason for concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know.
An innocent man is now imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator." The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone. "So help me God!" said he, after a brief pause, "I will tell you all I know about this affair; but I do not expect you to believe one-half I say I would be a fool indeed if I did.
Still, I am innocent, and I will make a clean breast if I die for it." What he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage to the Indian Archipelago.
A party, of which he formed one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure. Himself and a companion had captured the Orang-Outang. This companion dying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After a great trouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter on board ship.
His ultimate design was to sell it. Returning home from some sailor's frolic on the night, or rather in the morning, of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bedroom, into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as was thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the keyhole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do.
He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the Orang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street. The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand, occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at his pursuer, until the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this manner the chase continued for a long time.
The streets were profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning. In passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning-rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed.
The whole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by the Orang-Outang as it entered the room. The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down.
On the other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning-rod is ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror.
Now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived.
The flapping to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind. As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame L'Espanaye by the hair (which was loose, as she had been combing it), and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had swooned.
The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the Orang-Outang into those of wrath. With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into frenzy. Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired.
Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear. Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the window headlong. As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it, hurried at once home dreading the consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the Orang-Outang.
The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the brute. I have scarcely anything to add. The Orang-Outang must have escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the breaking of the door.
It must have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the Jardin des Plantes. Le Bon was instantly released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police.
This functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two about the propriety of every person minding his own business. "Let him talk," said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply. "Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience. I am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound.
In his wisdom is no stamen.
It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all.
I like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity; I mean the way he has 'de nier ce qui est, et d'expliquer ce qui n'est pas.'"*   * Rousseau Nouvelle Heloise. THE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET  BY EDGAR ALLAN POE This is quite properly designated, in the sub-title, as a sequel to the story that precedes it, though, as M. Dupin himself points out, the case presented is a far more intricate one. Explanations as to the origin of the story are omitted from this note, as they already appear with sufficient completeness in the foot-notes which accompany the opening of the story. THE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET[1]  A SEQUEL TO "THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE" By EDGAR ALLAN POE [1] Upon the original publication of "Marie Roget," the footnotes now appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient to give them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design. A young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the vicinity of New York; and although her death occasioned an intense and long-enduring excitement, the mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period when the present paper was written and published (November, 1842). Herein, under pretense of relating the fate of a Parisian grisette, the author has followed, in minute detail, the essential, while merely paralleling the inessential facts of the real murder of Mary Rogers. Thus all argument founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth: and the investigation of the truth was the object.
The "Mystery of Marie Roget" was composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity, and with no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded. Thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot and visited the localities. It may not be improper to record, nevertheless, that the confessions of two persons (one of them the Madame Deluc of the narrative), made at different periods, long subsequent to the publication, confirmed, in full, not only the general conclusion, but absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained. Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten, die der Wirklichkeit parallel lauft.
Selten fallen sie zusammen. Menschen und zufalle modificiren gewohnlich die idealische Begebenheit, so dass sie unvollkommen erscheint, und ihre Folgen gleichfalls unvollkommen sind.
So bei der Reformation; statt des Protestantismus kam das Lutherthum hervor.
There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real ones. They rarely coincide. Men and circumstances generally modify the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and its consequences are equally imperfect. Thus with the Reformation; instead of Protestantism came Lutheranism.

There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in the supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvelous a character that, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive them. Such sentiments for the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of thought such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now, this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in speculation. The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make public, will be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences, whose secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder of Marie Cecilia Rogers, at New York.
When, in an article entitled "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," I endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject. This depicting of character constituted my design; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance Dupin's idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples, but I should have proved no more.
Late events, however, in their surprising development, have startled me into some further details, which will carry with them the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have lately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to what I both heard and saw so long ago.
Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie. Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor; and continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we gave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present, weaving the dull world around us into dreams. But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted.
It may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend in the drama at the Rue Morgue had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the Parisian police. With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into a household word. The simple character of those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the Prefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the Chevalier's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition. His frankness would have led him to disabuse every inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all further agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased. It thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of the political eyes; and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the Prefecture.
One of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named Marie Rogêt. This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue Morgue. Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate "cigar girl," was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt.
The father had died during the child's infancy, and from the period of his death, until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée[3]; Madame there keeping a pension, assisted by Marie.  Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood. Monsieur Le Blanc[4] was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair Marie in his perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by Madame. [3] Nassau Street.

The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of sprightly grisette. She had been in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown into confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop. Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for her absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations when, one fine morning after the lapse of a week, Marie in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her reappearance at her usual counter in the perfumery.
All inquiry, except that of a private character, was, of course, immediately hushed. Monsieur Le Blanc professed total ignorance, as before. Marie, with Madame, replied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country.
Thus the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée. It was about five months after this return home that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time. Three days elapsed, and nothing was heard of her. On the fourth her corpse was found floating in the Seine,[5] near the shore which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andrée, and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule.[6] [5] The Hudson.

The atrocity of this murder (for it was at once evident that murder had been committed), the youth and beauty of the victim and, above all, her previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect. For several weeks, in the discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten.
The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the powers of the whole Parisian police, were, of course, tasked to the utmost extent. "Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the meantime the investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased.
At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists in Paris against the police having given vent to itself in several serious emeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty-thousand francs "for the conviction of the assassin," or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated, "for the conviction of any one of the assassins." In the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.
No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light. But although, in one or two instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith.
Strange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind reached the ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which had absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visitor, or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers. The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by G, in person. He called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18 , and remained with us until late in the night. He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins.
His reputation so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air was at stake. Even his honor was concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin, and made him a direct and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.
The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether provisional. This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at once, into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in possession. He discoursed much, and, beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.
Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed armchair, was the embodiment of respectful attention. He wore spectacles during the whole interview; and an occasional glance beneath their green glasses sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure of the Prefect. In the morning I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all that was positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:  Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, about nine o'clock in the morning of day, June the twenty-second, 18 .
In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques St. Eustache,[7] and to him only, of her intention to spend the day with an aunt, who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct course possible, from the pension of Madame Rogêt. St. Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at the pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home.
In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt's (as she had done under similar circumstances before), he did not think it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, Madame Rogêt (who was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age) was heard to express a fear "that she should never see Marie again"; but this observation attracted little attention at the time. [7] Payne.
On Monday it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des Drômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city and its environs. It was not, however, until the fourth day from the period of her disappearance that anything satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June) a Monsieur Beauvais,[8] who, with a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barrière du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen, who had found it floating in the river.
Upon seeing the body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the perfumery girl. His friend recognized it more promptly. [8] Crommelin.
The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the mouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue. About the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over on the chest, and were rigid.
The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. On the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution.
A part of the right wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope, but none of the excoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of the neck was much swollen. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of blows.
A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just under the left ear. This alone would have sufficed to produce death. The medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She had been subjected, it is said, to brutal violence.
The corpse was in such condition when found that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends. The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.
The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out torn very evenly and with great care. It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot. Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace the strings of a bonnet were attached, the bonnet being appended.
The knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened was not a lady's, but a slip or sailor's knot. After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the Morgue (this formality being superfluous), but hastily interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted. A weekly paper,[9] however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a reexamination instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted. The clothes, however, were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.
[9] The New York "Mercury.
" Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were arrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion; and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subsequently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G, affidavits, accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated, and journalists busied themselves in suggestions.
Among these, the one which attracted the most notice was the idea that Marie Rogêt still lived that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal translations from "L'Etoile,"[10] a paper conducted, in general, with much ability. [10] The New York "Brother Jonathan," edited by H. Hastings Weld, Esq.   "Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother's house on Sunday morning, June the twenty-second, 18 , with the ostensible purpose of going to see her aunt, or some other connection, in the Rue des Drômes. From that hour nobody is proved to have seen her.
There is no trace or tidings of her at all.... There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who saw her at all on that day, after she left her mother's door.... Now, though we have no evidence that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière du Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mother's house, only three days from the time she left her home three days to an hour.
But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.
Those who are guilty of such horrid crimes choose darkness rather than light.... Thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Rogêt, it could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at the outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water.
Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if left alone. Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature? ... If the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days.
And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken." The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water "not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days," because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty in recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully disproved. I continue the translation:   "What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no doubt the body was that of Marie Rogêt?
He ripped up the gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it something as indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve.
M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If we allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go over (which is allowing a great deal), there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie. Nobody went over. There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the occupants of the same building. M. St. Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother's house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it.
For an item of news like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received." In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations amount to this: that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these friends upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death.
But "L'Etoile" was again overhasty.
It was distinctly proved that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty; that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M.  Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although it was stated by "L'Etoile" that the corpse was reinterred at the public expense, that an advantageous offer of private sepulture absolutely declined by the family, and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial; although, I say, all this was asserted by "L'Etoile" in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey yet all this was satisfactorily disproved. In a subsequent number of the paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor says:   "Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that, on one occasion, while a Madame B was at Madame Rogêt's house, M. Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and that she, Madame B., must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned, but let the matter be for him....
In the present posture of affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. A single step can not be taken without M. Beauvais, for, go which way you will, you run against him.... For some reason he determined that nobody shall have anything to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body."
By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon Beauvais. A visitor at his office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a rose in the keyhole of the door, and the name "Marie" inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand. The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang of desperadoes that by these she had been borne across the river, maltreated, and murdered.
"Le Commerciel,"[11] however, a print of extensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea. I quote a passage or two from its columns: [11] New York "Journal of Commerce. " "We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so far as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule. It is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew her.
It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out.... It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or to the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside her mother's door, and there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the murder had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement.
The fact that the body was found floating near the Barrière is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water.... A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief." A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least, the chief portion of "Le Commerciel's" argument.
Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool. On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The handkerchief bore the name "Marie Rogêt. " Fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around.
The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burden having been dragged along it. A weekly paper, "Le Soleil,"[12] had the following comments upon this discovery comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole Parisian press: [12] Philadelphia "Saturday Evening Post," edited by C. I. Peterson, Esq.
"The things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain, and stuck together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them. The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened.... The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long.
One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem. They looked like strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the ground.... There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered. " Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. Madame Deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river, opposite the Barrière du Roule.
The neighborhood is secluded particularly so. It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards from the city, who cross the river in boats. About three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn, accompanied by a young man of dark complexion. The two remained here for some time. On their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity.
Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative. A scarf was particularly noticed. Soon after the departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and recrossed the river as if in great haste.
It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn. The screams were violent but brief. Madame D. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket, but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse. An omnibus driver, Valence,[13] now also testified that he saw Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in question, in company with a young man of dark complexion.
He, Valence, knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity. The articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of Marie. [13] Adam.
The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself, from the newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only one more point but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence. It appears that, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described, the lifeless or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache, Marie's betrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage. A phial labeled "laudanum," and emptied, was found near him. His breath gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking.
Upon his person was found a letter, briefly stating his love for Marie, with his design of self-destruction. "I need scarcely tell you," said Dupin, as he finished the perusal of my notes, "that this is a far more intricate case than that of the Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect. This is an ordinary, although an atrocious, instance of crime. There is nothing peculiarly outre about it.
You will observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have been considered difficult, of solution. Thus, at first, it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed. They could picture to their imaginations a mode many modes and a motive many motives; and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one, they have taken it for granted that one of them must. But the ease with which these variable fancies were entertained, and the very plausibility which each assumed, should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation.
I have, therefore, observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so much 'what has occurred?' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before?' In the investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye,[14] the agents of G were discouraged and confounded by that very unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the perfumery girl, and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.
[14] See "Murders in the Rue Morgue." "In the case of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, there was, even at the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder had been committed. The idea of suicide was excluded at once.
Here, too, we are freed, at the commencement, from all supposition of self-murder. The body found at the Barrière du Roule was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point. But it has been suggested that the corpse discovered is not that of the Marie Rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been arranged with the Prefect.
We both know this gentleman well. It will not do to trust him too far. If, dating our inquiries from the body found, and then tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than Marie; or if, starting from the living Marie, we find her, yet find her unassassinated in either case we lose our labor; since it is Monsieur G with whom we have to deal.
For our own purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the Marie Rogêt who is missing. "With the public the arguments of 'L'Etoile' have had weight; and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject 'Several of the morning papers of the day,' it says, 'speak of the conclusive article in Monday's "'Etoile."'  To me, this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer. We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation to make a point than to further the cause of truth. The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former. The print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however well founded this opinion may be) earns for itself no credit with the mob.
The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of merit. "What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrame of the idea, that Marie Rogêt still lives, rather than any true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to 'L'Etoile,' and secured it a favorable reception with the public.  Let us examine the heads of this journal's argument; endeavoring to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth. "The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse, that this corpse can not be that of Marie.
The reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an object with the reasoner. In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the outset. 'It is folly to suppose,' he says, 'that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.' We demand at once, and very naturally, Why?
Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girl's quitting her mother's house?
Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day? There have been assassinations at all hours. But, had the murder taken place at any moment between nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday and a quarter before midnight, there would still have been time enough 'to throw the body into the river before midnight.' This assumption, then, amounts precisely to this that the murder was not committed on Sunday at all and, if we allow 'L'Etoile' to assume this, we may permit it any liberties whatever.
The paragraph beginning 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, etc.,' however it appears as printed in 'L'Etoile,' may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain of its inditer: 'It is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the body, could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same time (as we are resolved to suppose), that the body was not thrown in until after midnight' a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed. "Were it my purpose," continued Dupin, "merely to make out a case against this passage of 'L'Etoile's' argument, I might safely leave it where it is. It is not, however, with 'L'Etoile' that we have to do, but with the truth.
The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated; but it is material that we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have obviously intended, and failed to convey. It was the design of the journalists to say that at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight. And herein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain.
It is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position, and under such circumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now, the assassination might have taken place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to at any period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal. You will understand that I suggest nothing here as probable, or as coincident with my opinion. My design, so far, has no reference to the facts of the case.
I wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of 'L'Etoile's' suggestion, by calling your attention to its ex-parte character at the outset. "Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions; having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it could have been in the water but a very brief time, the journal goes on to say:  "'All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.' "These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in Paris, with the exception of 'Le Moniteur.'[15] This latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to 'drowned bodies' only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by 'L'Etoile.' But there is something excessively unphilosophical in the attempt, on the part of 'Le Moniteur,' to rebut the general assertion of 'L'Etoile,' by a citation of particular instances militating against that assertion.
Had it been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to 'L'Etoile's' rule, until such time as the rule itself should be confuted. Admitting the rule (and this 'Le Moniteur' does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions), the argument of 'L'Etoile' is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days; and this probability will be in favor of 'L'Etoile's' position until the instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule. [15] The New York "Commercial Advertiser" edited by Colonel Stone. "You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the rationale of the rule.
Now the human body, in general, is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from the sea. But, leaving this tide out of the question, it may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh water, of their own accord.
Almost any one, falling into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own that is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as possible. The proper position for one who can not swim is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface. Thus circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion.
It is evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are invariably thrown upward, while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position.
The result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs. Much is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them. This difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient in the case of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals float even after drowning. "The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces.
This effect is brought about by decomposition or otherwise. The result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is so horrible. When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death.
Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with anything like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition. Under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour; under others it might not take place at all. There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the bichloride of mercury is one. But, apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter (or within other cavities from other causes), sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the surface.
The effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is embedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue, allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas. "Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can easily test by it the assertions of 'L'Etoile.'  'All experience shows,' says this paper, 'that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.' "The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence and incoherence. All experience does not show that 'drowned bodies' require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface.
Both science and experience show that the period of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If, moreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will not 'sink again if let alone,' until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between 'drowned bodies,' and 'bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.' Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes them all in the same category.
I have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggle by which he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface gasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body 'thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.' Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule, would not sink at all a fact of which 'L'Etoile' is evidently ignorant. When decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones then, indeed, but not till then, should we lose sight of the corpse. "And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could not be that of Marie Rogêt, because, three days only having elapsed, this body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman, she might never have sunk; or, having sunk, might have reappeared in twenty-four hours or less. But no one supposes her to have been drowned; and, dying before being thrown into the river, she might have been found floating at any period afterward whatever.
"'But,' says 'L'Etoile,' 'if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.' Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theory viz.: that the body was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid decomposition more rapid than if immersed in water. He supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances it could have so appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore; for, if so, 'some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.' I presume you smile at the sequitur. You can not be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply traces of the assassins. Nor can I.  "'And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,' continues our journal, 'that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken.' Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought! No one not even 'L'Etoile' disputes the murder committed on the body found.
The marks of violence are too obvious. It is our reasoner's object merely to show that this body is not Marie's. He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated not that the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter point.
Here is a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in, would not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in by murderers.
This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question of identity is not even approached, and 'L'Etoile' has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before. ' We are perfectly convinced,' it says, 'that the body found was that of a murdered female.' "Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his subject, where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself.
His evident object, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as possible, the interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the corpse. Yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mother's house.
'We have no evidence,' he says, 'that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second.' As his argument is obviously an ex parte one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for had any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, the interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the grisette. It is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that 'L'Etoile' insists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general argument. "Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the identification of the corpse by Beauvais. In regard to the hair upon the arm, 'L'Etoile' has been obviously disingenuous.
M. Beauvais, not being an idiot, could never have urged in identification of the corpse, simply hair upon its arm. No arm is without hair. The generality of the expression of 'L'Etoile' is a mere perversion of the witness's phraseology. He must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been a peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.
"'Her foot,' says the journal, 'was small so are thousands of feet. Her garter is no proof whatever nor is her shoe for shoes and garters are sold in packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her hat. One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp on the garter found had been set back to take it in. This amounts to nothing; for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try them in the store where they purchase.' Here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to the question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search had been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size and contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly strengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark.
If, the feet of Marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative. Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be 'sold in packages,' you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain. What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes through its corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then, flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek for nothing further. If only one flower, we seek for nothing further what then if two or three, or more?
Each successive one is multiple evidence proof not added to proof, but multiplied by hundreds or thousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by Marie shortly previous to her leaving home.
It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt. What 'L'Etoile' says in respect to this abbreviation of the garters being an unusual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error. The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the unusualness of the abbreviation. What is made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely.
It must have been by an accident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of Marie needed the tightening described. They alone would have amply established her identity. But it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance it is that the corpse had each, and all collectively.
Could it be proved that the editor of 'L'Etoile' really entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a commission de lunatico inquirendo. He has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts. I would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect. For the court, guided itself by the general principles of evidence the recognized and booked principles is averse from swerving at particular instances.
And this steadfast adherence to principle, with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth, in any long sequence of time. The practise, en masse, is therefore philosophical; but it is not the less certain that it engenders vast individual error.[16] [16] "A theory based on the qualities of an object, will prevent its being unfolded according to its objects; and he who arranges topics in reference to their causes, will cease to value them according to their results. Thus the jurisprudence of every nation will show that, when law becomes a science and a system, it ceases to be justice. The errors into which a blind devotion to principles of classification has led the common law will be seen by observing how often the legislature has been obliged to come forward to restore the equity its scheme had lost."
Landor.
"In respect to the insinuations leveled at Beauvais, you will be willing to dismiss them in a breath. You have already fathomed the true character of this good gentleman. He is a busybody, with much of romance and little of wit. Any one so constituted will readily so conduct himself, upon occasion of real excitement, as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over-acute, or the ill-disposed. M. Beauvais (as it appears from your notes) had some personal interviews with the editor of 'L'Etoile' and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober fact, that of Marie. ' He persists,' says the paper, 'in asserting the corpse to be that of Marie, but can not give a circumstance, in addition to those which we have commented upon, to make others believe.' Now, without readverting to the fact that stronger evidence 'to make others believe' could never have been adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to believe, in a case of this kind, without the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party. Nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity. Each man recognizes his neighbor, yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his recognition. The editor of 'L'Etoile' had no right to be offended at M. Beauvais's unreasoning belief.
"The suspicious circumstances which invest him will be found to tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic busybodyism than with the reasoner's suggestion of guilt. Once adopting the more charitable interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in the key-hole; the 'Marie' upon the slate; the 'elbowing the male relatives out of the way'; the 'aversion to permitting them to see the body'; the caution given to Madame B, that she must hold no conversation with the gendarme until his (Beauvais's) return; and, lastly, his apparent determination 'that nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except himself.' It seems to me unquestionable that Beauvais was a suitor of Marie's; that she coquetted with him; and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the evidence fully rebuts the assertion of 'L'Etoile,' touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives an apathy inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumery girl we shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction.
" "And what," I here demanded, "do you think of the opinions of 'Le Commerciel'?" "That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at least, are founded in imperfect observation. 'Le Commerciel' wishes to intimate that Marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her mother's door. 'It is impossible,' it urges, 'that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her.' This is the idea of a man long resident in Paris a public man and one whose walks to and fro in the city have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices. He is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own bureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery girl, finds no great difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his.
This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying, methodical character, and within the same species of limited region as are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own. But the walks of Marie may, in general, be supposed discursive.
In this particular instance, it will be understood as most probable, that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of 'Le Commerciel' would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals traversing the whole city. In this case, granting the personal acquaintance to be equal, the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal rencontres would be made. For my own part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as far more than probable, that Marie might have proceeded, at any given period, by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt, without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was known. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris itself.
"But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of 'Le Commerciel,' will be much diminished when we take into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad. 'It was when the streets were full of people,' says 'Le Commerciel,' 'that she went out.' But not so.
It was at nine o'clock in the morning. Now at nine o'clock of every morning in the week, with the exception of Sunday, the streets of the city are, it is true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are chiefly within doors preparing for church. No observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath.
Between ten and eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so early a period as that designated. "There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation on the part of 'Le Commerciel.'  'A piece,' it says, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.' Whether this idea is or is not well founded, we will endeavor to see hereafter; but by 'fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs,' the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians. These, however, are the very description of people who will always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts. You must have had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to the thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief."
"And what are we to think," I asked, "of the article in 'Le Soleil'?" "That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot in which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race. He has merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion; collecting them, with a laudable industry, from this paper and from that.
' The things had all evidently been there,' he says, 'at least three or four weeks, and there can be no doubt that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered.' The facts here restated by 'Le Soleil' are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject, and we will examine them more particularly hereafter in connection with another division of the theme. "At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations. You can not have failed to remark the extreme laxity of the examination of the corpse.
To be sure, the question of identity was readily determined, or should have been; but there were other points to be ascertained. Had the body been in any respect despoiled? Had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home?
If so, had she any when found?
These are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence; and there are others of equal moment, which have met with no attention. We must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry. The case of St. Eustache must be reexamined. I have no suspicion of this person; but let us proceed methodically.
We will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the affidavits in regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday. Affidavits of this character are readily made matter of mystification. Should there be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St. Eustache from our investigations.
His suicide, however corroborative of suspicion, were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is, without such deceit, in no respect an unaccountable circumstance, or one which need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary analysis. "In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points of this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts. Not the least usual error in investigations such as this is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events.
It is the malpractice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger, portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant.
It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me.
The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest, allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical to base upon what has been a vision of what is to be. Accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure.
We make chance a matter of absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and unimagined to the mathematical formulæ of the schools. "I repeat that it is no more than fact that the larger portion of all truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this fact that I would divert inquiry, in the present case, from the trodden and hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself to the contemporary circumstances which surround it.
While you ascertain the validity of the affidavits, I will examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done. So far, we have only reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be strange, indeed, if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the public prints will not afford us some minute points which shall establish a direction for inquiry." In pursuance of Dupin's suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of the affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction of their validity, and of the consequent innocence of St. Eustache.
In the meantime my friend occupied himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness altogether objectless, in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files. At the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts:  "About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to the present was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie Rogêt from the parfumerie of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais Royal. At the end of a week, however, she reappeared at her customary comptoir, as well as ever, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual. It was given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother that she had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was speedily hushed up.
We presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature, and that, at the expiration of a week or, perhaps, of a month, we shall have her among us again. " Evening Paper, Monday, June 23.[17] [17] New York "Express."
"An evening journal of yesterday refers to a former mysterious disappearance of Mademoiselle Rogêt. It is well known that, during the week of her absence from Le Blanc's parfumerie, she was in the company of a young naval officer much noted for his debaucheries. A quarrel, it is supposed, providentially, led to her return home. We have the name of the Lothario in question, who is at present stationed in Paris, but for obvious reasons forbear to make it public."
"Le Mercurie," Tuesday Morning, June 24.[18] [18] New York "Herald.
" "An outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this city the day before yesterday. A gentleman, with his wife and daughter, engaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the river. Upon reaching the opposite shore the three passengers stepped out, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat, when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol.
She returned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents. The villains have escaped for the time, but the police are upon their trail, and some of them will soon be taken. " Morning Paper, June 25.[19] [19] New York "Courier and Inquirer.
" "We have received one or two communications, the object of which is to fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon Mennais[20]; but as this gentleman has been fully exonerated by a legal inquiry, and as the arguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than profound, we do not think it advisable to make them public." Morning Paper, June 28.[21] [20] Mennais was one of the parties originally suspected and arrested, but discharged through total lack of evidence. [21] New York "Courier and Inquirer.
" "We have received several forcibly written communications, apparently from various sources, and which go far to render it a matter of certainty that the unfortunate Marie Rogêt has become a victim of one of the numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city upon Sunday. Our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this supposition. We shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments hereafter."
Evening Paper, Tuesday, June 31.[22] [22] New York "Evening Post.
" "On Monday, one of the bargemen connected with the revenue service saw an empty boat floating down the Seine. Sails were lying in the bottom of the boat. The bargeman towed it under the barge office. The next morning it was taken from thence without the knowledge of any of the officers.
The rudder is now at the barge office. " "Le Diligence," Thursday, June 26.[23] [23] New York "Standard.
" Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand. I waited for some explanation from Dupin. "It is not my present design," he said, "to dwell upon the first and second of these extracts. I have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to.
Yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of Marie there is no supposable connection.
Let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed. We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know that an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the betrayer's advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual we are prepared to regard it as a 'making up' of the old amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one. The chances are ten to one that he who had once eloped with Marie would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of an elopement had been made by one individual should have them made to her by another. And here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first ascertained and the second supposed elopement is a few months more than the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war. Had the lover been interrupted in his first villainy by the necessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished or not yet altogether accomplished by him?
Of all these things we know nothing. "You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no elopement as imagined. Certainly not but are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design? Beyond St. Eustache, and perhaps Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of Marie. Of none other is there anything said.
Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du Roule?
Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the relatives know nothing? And what means the singular prophecy of Madame Rogêt on the morning of Marie's departure? 'I fear that I shall never see Marie again.' "But if we can not imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of elopement, may we not at least suppose this sign entertained by the girl? Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Drômes, and St. Eustache was requested to call for her at dark. Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion but let us reflect.
That she did meet some companion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barrière du Roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon, is known. But in consenting so to accompany this individual (for whatever purpose to her mother known or unknown), she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Drômes, he should find that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from home.
She must have thought of these things, I say. She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all. She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we suppose her not intending to return. "We may imagine her thinking thus 'I am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to myself.
It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption there must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Drômes I will tell St. Eustache not to call for me until dark in this way, my absence from home for the longest possible period, without causing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain more time than in any other manner. If I bid St. Eustache call for me at dark, he will be sure not to call before; but if I wholly neglect to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner excite anxiety. Now, if it were my design to return at all if I had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question it would not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for calling, he will be sure to ascertain that I have played him false a fact of which I might keep him forever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes. But, as it is my design never to return or not for some weeks or not until certain concealments are effected the gaining of time is the only point about which I need give myself any concern.' "You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards.
Now, the popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be disregarded. When arising of itself when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would abide by its decision. But it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion.
The opinion must be rigorously the public's own; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain. In the present instance, it appears to me that this 'public opinion,' in respect to a gang, has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts. All Paris is excited by the discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful, and notorious. This corpse is found bearing marks of violence, and floating in the river.
But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetrated by a gang of young ruffians upon the person of a second young female.
Is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown? This judgment awaited direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it! Marie, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed. The connection of the two events had about it so much of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it.
But, in fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, if anything, evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed.
It would have been a miracle if, while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the same period of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvelous train of coincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe?  "Before proceeding further, let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule.
This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and a footstool. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found.
The handkerchief bore the name 'Marie Rogêt.' Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent struggle. "Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt.
That it was the scene, I may or I may not believe but there was excellent reason for doubt. Had the true scene been, as 'Le Commerciel' suggested, in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert this attention. And thus, the thicket of the Barrière du Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were found might have been naturally entertained.
There is no real evidence, although 'Le Soleil' so supposes, that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys. ' They were all mildewed down hard,' says 'Le Soleil,' adopting the opinions of its predecessors, 'with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them.
The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on being opened.' In respect to the grass having 'grown around and over some of them,' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party. But the grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather (such as was that of the period of the murder), as much as two or three inches in a single day.
A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week, be entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. And touching that mildew upon which the editor of 'Le Soleil' so pertinaciously insists that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew? Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus, of which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence within twenty-four hours? "Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles had been 'for at least three or four weeks' in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact.
On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified for a longer period than a single week for a longer period than from one Sunday to the next. Those who know anything of the vicinity of Paris know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion, unless at a great distance from its suburbs. Such a thing as an unexplored or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be imagined.
Let any one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis let any such one attempt, even during the week-days, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us. At every second step he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards. He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain. Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound here are the temples most desecrate.
With sickness of the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. But if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week, how much more so on the Sabbath!
It is now especially that, released from the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society. He desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the country. Here, at the roadside inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he indulges unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity the joint offspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered for a longer period than from one Sunday to another in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of Paris is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous.
"But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage. And first, let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles. Collate this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers.
You will find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper. These communications, although various, and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point viz.: the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its scene.
Now, here, of course, the situation is not that, in consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well have been that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the date of the communication, by the guilty authors of these communications themselves. "This thicket was a singular an exceedingly singular one. It was unusually dense.
Within its naturally walled inclosure were three extraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and a footstool. And this thicket, so full of art, was in the immediate vicinity, within a few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras. Would it be a rash wager a wager of one thousand to one that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon its natural throne?
Those who would hesitate at such a wager have either never been boys themselves or have forgotten the boyish nature. I repeat it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered for a longer period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of 'Le Soleil,' that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found. "But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now, let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles.
On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf; scattered around were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name 'Marie Rogêt.' Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not overacute person wishing to dispose the articles naturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement.
I should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons. 'There was evidence,' it is said, 'of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken' but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves.
' The pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended. They looked like strips torn off.'  Here, inadvertently, 'Le Soleil' has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase.
The pieces, as described, do indeed 'look like strips torn off'; but purposely and by hand. It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is 'torn off,' from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn. From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming tangled in them, tears them rectangularly divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece 'torn off.' I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost every case, required. If there be two edges to the fabric if, for example, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But in the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge.
To tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one thorn could accomplish it. But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in one.
And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed. If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question. We thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being 'torn off' through the simple agency of 'thorns'; yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. 'And one part,' too, 'was the hem of the frock!' Another piece was 'part of the skirt, not the hem' that is to say, was torn completely out, through the agency of thorns, from the unedged interior of the dress! These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground for suspicion than the one startling circumstance of the articles having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. You will not have apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might have been a wrong here, or more possibly an accident at Madame Deluc's.
But, in fact, this is a point of minor importance.
We are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the murder. What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of 'Le Soleil,' but secondly, and chiefly, to bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has, or has not, been the work of a gang. "We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest.
It is only necessary to say that his published inferences, in regard to the number of the ruffians, have been properly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable anatomists of Paris. Not that the matter might not have been as inferred, but that there was no ground for the inference was there not much for another? "Let us reflect now upon 'the traces of a struggle'; and let me ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate.
A gang.
But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?
What struggle could have taken place what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its 'traces' in all directions between a weak and defenseless girl and a gang of ruffians imagined?
The silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over. The victim must have been absolutely passive at their will. You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene, are applicable, in chief part, only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual. If we imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive, the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the 'traces' apparent. "And again.
I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the thicket where discovered.
It seems almost impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found. There was sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse; and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay) is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outrage I allude to the handkerchief with the name of the deceased. If this was accident, it was not the accident of a gang. We can imagine it only the accident of an individual.
Let us see. An individual has committed the murder. He is alone with the ghost of the departed. He is appalled by what lies motionless before him.
The fury of his passion is over, and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed. His is none of that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires. He is alone with the dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse.
He bears it to the river, and leaves behind him the other evidences of his guilt; for it is difficult, if not impossible, to carry all the burden at once, and it will be easy to return for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to the water his fears redouble within him.
The sounds of life encompass his path. A dozen times he hears or fancies he hears the step of an observer. Even the very lights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time, and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, he reaches the river's brink, and disposes of his ghastly charge perhaps through the medium of a boat.
But now what treasure does the world hold what threat of vengeance could it hold out which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and its blood-chilling recollections?
He returns not, let the consequences be what they may.
He could not return if he would. His sole thought is immediate escape. He turns his back forever upon those dreadful shrubberies, and flees as from the wrath to come. "But how with a gang?
Their number would have inspired them with confidence; if, indeed, confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the supposed gangs ever constituted.
Their number, I say, would have prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which I have imagined to paralyze the single man. Could we suppose an oversight in one, or two, or three, this oversight would have been remedied by a fourth. They would have left nothing behind them; for their number would have enabled them to carry all at once. There would have been no need of return.
"Consider now the circumstance that, in the outer garment of the corpse when found, 'a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist, wound three times round the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.' This was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to carry the body. But would any number of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient?
To three or four, the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the best possible, hold. The device is that of a single individual; and this brings us to the fact that 'between the thicket and the river the rails of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it!' But would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant?
Would a number of men have so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the dragging?
"And here we must refer to an observation of 'Le Commerciel'; upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. 'A piece,' says this journal, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.' "I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a pocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I now especially advert.
That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose imagined by 'Le Commerciel,' that this bandage was employed, is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object was not 'to prevent screams' appears, also, from the bandage having been employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as 'found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.' These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially from those of 'Le Commerciel.' The slip was eighteen inches wide, and therefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally.
And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference is this. The solitary murderer, having borne the corpse for some distance (whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the bandage hitched around its middle, found the weight, in this mode of procedure, too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the burden the evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object in view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities.
It could be best attached about the neck, where the head would prevent its slipping off. And now the murderer bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He would have used this, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch which embarrassed it, and the reflection that it had not been 'torn off' from the garment.
It was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat. He tore it, made it fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the river. That this 'bandage,' only attainable with trouble and delay, and but imperfectly answering its purpose that this bandage was employed at all, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer attainable that is to say, arising, as we have imagined, after quitting the thicket (if the thicket it was), and on the road between the thicket and the river. "But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc (!) points especially to the presence of a gang in the vicinity of the thicket, at or about the epoch of the murder.
This I grant. I doubt if there were not a dozen gangs, such as described by Madame Deluc, in and about the vicinity of the Barrière du Roule at or about the period of this tragedy. But the gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, through the somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence, of Madame Deluc, is the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old lady as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy, without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment.
Et hinc illæ iræ?
"But what is the precise evidence of Madame Deluc? 'A gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young man and the girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and recrossed the river as if in great haste.' "Now this 'great haste' very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her violated cakes and ale cakes and ale for which she might still have entertained a faint hope of compensation. Why, otherwise, since it was about dusk, should she make a point of the haste? It is no cause for wonder, surely, that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get home when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm impends, and when night approaches.
"I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only about dusk that the indecent haste of these 'miscreants' offended the sober eyes of Madame Deluc. But we are told that it was upon this very evening that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, 'heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn.' And in what words does Madame Deluc designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard? ' It was soon after dark' she says. But 'soon after dark' is, at least, dark; and 'about dusk,' is as certainly daylight.
Thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the screams overheard (?) by Madame Deluc. And although, in all the many reports of the evidence, the relative expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just as I have employed them in this conversation with yourself, no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been taken by any of the public journals, or by any of the myrmidons of police. "I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this one has, to my own understanding at least, a weight altogether irresistible.
Under the circumstances of large reward offered, and full pardon to any king's evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a moment, that some member of a gang of low ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices. Each one of a gang, so placed, is not so much greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal. He betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed.
That the secret has not been divulged is the very best of proof that it is, in fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to one or two living human beings, and to God. "Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis. We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of Madame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule, by a lover, or at least by an intimate and secret associate of the deceased. This associate is of swarthy complexion.
This complexion, the 'hitch' in the bandage, and the 'sailor's knot' with which the bonnet-ribbon is tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the deceased a gay but not an abject young girl designates him as above the grade of the common sailor. Here the well-written and urgent communications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration. The circumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by 'Le Mercurie,' tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the 'naval officer' who is first known to have led the unfortunate into crime.
"And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued absence of him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no common swarthiness which constituted the sole point of remembrance, both as regards Valence and Madame Deluc. But why is this man absent?
Was he murdered by the gang?
If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl? The scene of the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And where is his corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is deterred from making himself known, through dread of being charged with the murder.
This consideration might be supposed to operate upon him now at this late period since it has been given in evidence that he was seen with Marie, but it would have had no force at the period of the deed. The first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage, and to aid in identifying the ruffians. This policy would have suggested. He had been seen with the girl.
He had crossed the river with her in an open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would have appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving himself from suspicion. We can not suppose him, on the night of the fatal Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed. Yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of the assassins.
"And what means are ours of attaining the truth? We shall find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed. Let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let us know the full history of 'the officer,' with his present circumstances, and his whereabout at the precise period of the murder.
Let us carefully compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper, in which the object was to inculpate a gang. This done, let us compare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us again compare these various communications with the known MSS.
of the officer.
Let us endeavor to ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc and her boys, as well as of the omnibus-driver, Valence, something more of the personal appearance and bearing of the 'man of dark complexion.'  Queries, skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of these parties, information on this particular point (or upon others) information which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing. And let us now trace the boat picked up by the bargeman on the morning of Monday the twenty-third of June, and which was removed from the barge-office, without the cognizance of the officer in attendance, and without the rudder, at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse. With a proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the bargeman who picked it up identify it, but the rudder is at hand. The rudder of a sail boat would not have been abandoned, without inquiry, by one altogether at ease in heart.
And here let me pause to insinuate a question. There was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It was silently taken to the barge-office and as silently removed.
But its owner or employer how happened he, at so early a period as Tuesday morning, to be informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the locality of the boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connection with the navy some personal permanent connection leading to cognizance of its minute interests its petty local news?
"In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore, I have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a boat. Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt was precipitated from a boat. This would naturally have been the case. The corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore.
The peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat. That the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the idea. If thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off. In the act of consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have noticed his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand.
Any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore. Having rid himself of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have hastened to the city. There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped on land.
But the boat would he have secured it?
He would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat.
Moreover, in fastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if securing evidence against himself. His natural thought would have been to cast from him, as far as possible, all that had held connection with his crime. He would not only have fled from the wharf, but he would not have permitted the boat to remain. Assuredly he would have cast it adrift.
Let us pursue our fancies. In the morning, the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting at a locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him to frequent. The next night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he removes it.
Now where is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first purposes to discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of our success shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which will surprise even ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the murderer will be traced.
" [For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many readers will appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here omitting, from the MSS. placed in our hands, such portion as details the following up of the apparently slight clue obtained by Dupin. We feel it advisable only to state, in brief, that the result desired was brought to pass; and that the Prefect fulfilled punctually, although with reluctance, the terms of his compact with the Chevalier. Mr. Poe's article concludes with the following words.
Eds.[24]] [24] Of the Magazine in which the article was originally published. It will be understood that I speak of coincidences and no more. What I have said above upon this topic must suffice.
In my own heart there dwells no faith in preternature. That Nature and its God are two, no man who thinks will deny. That the latter, creating the former, can, at will, control or modify it, is also unquestionable. I say "at will"; for the question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power. It is not that the Deity can not modify his laws, but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification.
In their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the Future. With God all is Now. I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences. And further: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of the unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that fate is known, and the fate of one Marie Rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history, there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes embarrassed.
I say all this will be seen. But let it not for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative of Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its denouement the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel, or even to suggest that the measures adopted in Paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette, or measures founded in any similar ratiocination, would produce any similar result.
For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations, by diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as, in arithmetic, an error which, in its own individuality, may be inappreciable, produces, at length, by dint of multiplication at all points of the process, a result enormously at variance with truth. And, in regard to the former branch, we must not fail to hold in view that the very Calculus of Probabilities to which I have referred, forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel forbids it with a positiveness strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been long-drawn and exact. This is one of those anomalous propositions which, seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical, is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain. Nothing, for example, is more difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by a player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt.
A suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It does not appear that the two throws which have been completed, and which lie now absolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the throw which exists only in the Future. The chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary time that is to say, subject only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice.
And this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything like respectful attention. The error here involved a gross error redolent of mischief I can not pretend to expose within the limits assigned me at present; with the philosophical it needs no exposure. It may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path of Reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail. THE PURLOINED LETTER BY EDGAR ALLAN POE This story, as may be seen from the opening paragraph, also concerns itself with that remarkable detective, M. Dupin.
Edmund Clarence Stedman considers it superior to the two stories that precede it, but Brander Matthews says that nothing better of their kind has ever been done than "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and "The Purloined Letter"; thus awarding equal praise to the first story and the third story. THE PURLOINED LETTER By EDGAR ALLAN POE Nil sapientiæ odiosius acumine nimio. Seneca At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18 , I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend, C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisieme, No. 33 Rue Dunot, Faubourg St. Germain.
For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G, the Prefect of the Parisian police.
We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G's saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble. "If it is any point requiring reflection," observed Dupin, as he forebore to enkindle the wick, "we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark." "That is another of your odd notions," said the Prefect, who had the fashion of calling everything "odd" that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of "oddities."
"Very true," said Dupin, as he supplied his visitor with a pipe, and rolled toward him a comfortable chair. "And what is the difficulty now?"
I asked. "Nothing more in the assassination way, I hope?" "Oh, no; nothing of that nature.
The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively odd." "Simple and odd!" said Dupin. "Why, yes; and not exactly that either.
The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether." "Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault," said my friend. "What nonsense you do talk!" replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.
"Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain," said Dupin. "Oh, good heavens!
who ever heard of such an idea?"
"A little too self-evident. " "Ha! ha!
ha! ha!
ha! ha! ho! ho! ho!" roared our visitor, profoundly amused, "oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!" "And what, after all, is the matter on hand?"
I asked. "Why, I will tell you," replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. "I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one."
"Proceed," said I. "Or not," said Dupin. "Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments.
The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession." "How is this known?" asked Dupin. "It is clearly inferred," replied the Prefect, "from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it."
"Be a little more explicit," I said. "Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable." The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.
"Still I do not quite understand," said Dupin. "No?
Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendency over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized." "But this ascendency," I interposed, "would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber. Who would dare " "The thief," said G, "is the Minister D, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.
The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question a letter, to be frank had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.
After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognizes the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other.
Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.
The minister decamped; leaving his own letter one of no importance upon the table." "Here, then," said Dupin to me, "you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendency complete the robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber." "Yes," replied the Prefect; "and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, can not be done openly.
In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me." "Than whom," said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, "no more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even imagined." "You flatter me," replied the Prefect; "but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained."
"It is clear," said I, "as you observe, that the letter is still in the possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs. " "True," said G; "and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.
Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design. " "But," said I, "you are quite au fait in these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing often before."
"Oh, yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk.
I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous.
So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed. " "But is it not possible," I suggested, "that although the letter may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?"
"This is barely possible," said Dupin. "The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues in which D is known to be involved, would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice a point of nearly equal importance with its possession."
"Its susceptibility of being produced?" said I. "That is to say, of being destroyed," said Dupin. "True," I observed; "the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider that as out of the question. " "Entirely," said the Prefect.
"He has been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person rigidly searched under my own inspection. " "You might have spared yourself this trouble," said Dupin. "D, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course. " "Not altogether a fool," said G, "but then he is a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a fool.
" "True," said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, "although I have been guilty of certain doggerel myself." "Suppose you detail," said I, "the particulars of your search." "Why, the fact is, we took our time, and we searched everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each.
We examined, first, the furniture of each department. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police-agent, such a thing as a 'secret' drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain.
There is a certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.
After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops." "Why so?"
"Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and the top replaced.
The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way."
"But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?" I asked. "By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides, in our case, we were obliged to proceed without noise.
" "But you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair, for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?"
"Certainly not; but we did better we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel, and, indeed, the jointings of every description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly.
A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the gluing any unusual gaping in the joints would have sufficed to ensure detection. " "I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the plates, and you probed the beds and the bedclothes, as well as the curtains and carpets." "That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house itself.
We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before." "The two houses adjoining! " I exclaimed; "you must have had a great deal of trouble." "We had; but the reward offered is prodigious. " "You include the ground about the houses?"
"All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks, and found it undisturbed."
"You looked among D's papers, of course, and into the books of the library?" "Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume, not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover, with the most accurate admeasurement, and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles."
"You explored the floors beneath the carpets?" "Beyond doubt.
We removed every carpet, and examined the boards with the microscope."
"And the paper on the walls?"
"Yes."
"You looked into the cellars?" "We did." "Then," I said, "you have been making a miscalculation, and the letter is not upon the premises, as you suppose.
" "I fear you are right there," said the Prefect. "And now, Dupin, what would you advise me to do?" "To make a thorough research of the premises." "That is absolutely needless," replied G.
"I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the hotel."
"I have no better advice to give you," said Dupin. "You have, of course, an accurate description of the letter?"
"Oh, yes!"
And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book, proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and especially of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure, more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before. In about a month afterward he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before.
He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said: "Well, but, G, what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the minister?" "Confound him, say I yes; I made the reexamination, however, as Dupin suggested but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would be."
"How much was the reward offered, did you say?" asked Dupin. "Why, a very great deal a very liberal reward I don't like to say how much, precisely; but one thing I will say, that I wouldn't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is, it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I have done." "Why, yes," said Dupin, drawlingly between the whiffs of his meerschaum, "I really think, G, you have not exerted yourself to the utmost in this matter.
You might do a little more, I think, eh?" "How?
in what way?"
"Why puff, puff you might puff, puff employ counsel in the matter, eh? puff, puff, puff. Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?" "No; hang Abernethy!" "To be sure!
hang him and welcome.
But, once upon a time, a certain rich miser conceived the design of sponging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion.
Getting up, for this purpose, an ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.
"'We will suppose,' said the miser, 'that his symptoms are such and such; now, doctor, what would you have directed him to take?' "'Take!' said Abernethy, 'why, take advice to be sure.'" "But," said the Prefect, a little discomposed, "I am perfectly willing to take advice, and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter."
"In that case," replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a check-book, "you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter."
I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking incredulously at my friend, with open mouth and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then apparently recovering himself in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect.
This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents, and then scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check. When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations. "The Parisian police," he said, "are exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D, I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation so far as his labors extended."
"So far as his labors extended?" said I. "Yes," said Dupin. "The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.
" I merely laughed but he seemed quite serious in all that he said. "The measures, then," he continued, "were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs.
But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.
I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one.
The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and holding up his closed hand, asks, 'Are they even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'Odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself: 'The simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd'; he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even'; he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the school-boy, whom his fellows termed 'lucky' what, in its last analysis, is it?"
"It is merely," I said, "an identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent.
" "It is," said Dupin; "and, upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted, I received answer as follows: 'When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.' This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to Campanella." "And the identification," I said, "of the reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent depends, if I understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured."
"For its practical value it depends upon this," replied Dupin; "and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged.
They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency by some extraordinary reward they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practise, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of D, has been done to vary the principle of action?
What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg, but, at least, in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also that such recherche nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed a disposal of it in this recherche manner is in the very first instance presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance or, what amounts to the same thing in the political eyes, when the reward is of magnitude the qualities in question have never been known to fail.
You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden anywhere within the limits of the Prefect's examination in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools." "But is this really the poet?"
I asked. "There are two brothers, I know; and both have attained reputation in letters.
The minister, I believe, has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician, and no poet. " "You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both.
As poet and mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect. " "You surprise me," I said, "by these opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.
"'Il y a a parier,'" replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, "'que toute idee publique, toute convention recue, est une sottise, car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.' The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra.
The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance if words derive any value from applicability then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' 'religion,' or 'homines honesti' a set of honorable men." "You have a quarrel on hand, I see," said I, "with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed." "I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any special form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study.
The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth.
What is true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails.
In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed imagines them to be.
"Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraists, however, who are pagans themselves, the 'pagan fables' are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x^2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x^2+px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down. "I mean to say," continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, "that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check.
I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary political modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected.
He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G, in fact, did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of political action in searches for articles concealed I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect.
I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident." "Yes," said I, "I remember his merriment well.
I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions." "The material world," continued Dupin, "abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics.
It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed, and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of attention?" "I have never given the matter a thought," I said. "There is a game of puzzles," he resumed, "which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word the name of town, river, state, or empire any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart.
A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect.
He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it. "But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand, if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search the more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all. "Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel. I found D at home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now alive but that is only when nobody sees him.
"To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host. "I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion. "At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a trumpery filigree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece.
In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the middle as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless, had been altered or stayed in the second.
It had a large black seal, bearing the D cipher very conspicuously, and was addressed, in a diminutive female hand, to D, the minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack. "No sooner had I glanced at this letter than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search.
To be sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black, with the D cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the S family. Here, the address, to the minister, was diminutive and feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things, together with the hyper obtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.
"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and while I maintained a most animated discussion with the minister, upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary.
They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned as a glove, inside out, redirected and resealed. I bade the minister good-morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table. "The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day.
While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a facsimile (so far as regards externals) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings imitating the D cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread. "The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children.
It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterward I bade him farewell.
The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay." "But what purpose had you," I asked, "in replacing the letter by a facsimile. Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and departed?"
"D," replied Dupin, "is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive.
The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations.
You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partizan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it were.
Thus will he commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends. He is that monstram horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius.
I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack." "How? did you put anything particular in it?"
"Why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that would have been insulting. D, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give him a clue.
He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words: "' Un dessein si funeste, S' il n' est digne d' Atree, est digne de Thyeste.' They are to be found in Crébillon's 'Atrée.' " THE SIGN OF THE FOUR BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is undoubtedly the most popular living writer of detective fiction. Sherlock Holmes is said to have been suggested to the author by a study of the character and talents of Joseph Bell, M.D., F.R.C.S., a professor, while Dr. Doyle was a student at Edinburgh University.
He was particularly strong on what the author calls "the science of deduction. " He used to tell the students their symptoms, and would even give them details of their past life. No collection of famous detective stories would be complete that omitted "The Sign of the Four."
THE SIGN OF THE FOUR By SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE  CHAPTER I The Science of Deduction Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist, all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sunk back into the velvet-lined armchair with a long sigh of satisfaction.
Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.
Yet upon that afternoon, whether it was the claret which I had taken with my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer.
"Which is it to-day?" I asked. "Morphine or cocaine?"
He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened.
"It is cocaine," he said; "a seven per cent solution. Would you care to try it?" "No, indeed," I answered, bruskly. "My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet. I can not afford to throw any extra strain upon it.
" He smiled at my vehemence. "Perhaps you are right, Watson," he said. "I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one. I find it, however, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment."
"But consider!"
I said, earnestly.
"Count the cost!
Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process, which involves increased tissue-change, and may at last leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle. Why should you, for a mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed?
Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable. " He did not seem offended. On the contrary, he put his finger-tips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who has a relish for conversation. "My mind," he said, "rebels at stagnation.
Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere, I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence.
I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world." "The only unofficial detective?"
I said, raising my eyebrows. "The only unofficial consulting detective," he answered.
"I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection. When Gregson, or Lestrade, or Athelney Jones are out of their depths which, by the way, is their normal state the matter is laid before me. I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper.
The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.
" "Yes, indeed," said I, cordially. "I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.' " He shook his head sadly.
"I glanced over it," said he. "Honestly, I can not congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid. " "But the romance was there," I remonstrated.
"I could not tamper with the facts. " "Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it. " I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him.
I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and though it did not prevent me from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.
"My practise has extended recently to the Continent," said Holmes, after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. "I was consulted last week by François le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some features of interest.
I was able to refer him to two parallel cases; the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance." He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign note-paper. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray "magnifiques," "coup-de-maîtres," and "tours-de-force," all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.
"He speaks as a pupil to his master," said I. "Oh, he rates my assistance too highly," said Sherlock Holmes, lightly. "He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge; and that may come in time.
He is now translating my small works into French." "Your works?"
"Oh, didn't you know?" he cried, laughing. "Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects.
Here, for example, is one 'Upon the Distinction Between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccos.' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar, cigarette, and pipe tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato."
"You have an extraordinary genius for minutiæ," I remarked. "I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses.
Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, cork-cutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers.
That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby.
" "Not at all," I answered, earnestly. "It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction.
Surely the one to some extent implies the other." "Why, hardly," he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his armchair, and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe. "For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you despatched a telegram."
"Right!" said I. "Right on both points! But I confess that I don't see how you arrived at it.
It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I have mentioned it to no one." "It is simplicity itself," he remarked, chuckling at my surprise; "so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mold adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, so far as I know, nowhere else in the neighborhood.
So much is observation. The rest is deduction." "How, then, did you deduce the telegram?"
"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat opposite to you all the morning. I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards.
What could you go into the postoffice for, then, but to send a wire?
Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth." "In this case it certainly is so," I replied, after a little thought. "The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?"
"On the contrary," he answered, "it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine.
I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me." "I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it. Now, I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner?"
I handed him the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed. He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens. I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face, when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back.
"There are hardly any data," he remarked. "The watch has been recently cleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts." "You are right," I answered.
"It was cleaned before being sent to me. " In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure. What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch?
"Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren," he observed, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes. "Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother, who inherited it from your father. " "That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?" "Quite so.
The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch; so it was made for the last generation. Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as his father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.
" "Right, so far," said I. "Anything else?" "He was a man of untidy habits very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time in poverty, with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died.
That is all I can gather. " I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart. "This is unworthy of you, Holmes," I said.
"I could not have believed that you would have descended to this. You have made inquiries into the history of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way. You can not expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch!
It is unkind, and, to speak plainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it." "My dear doctor," said he kindly, "pray accept my apologies. Viewing the matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you.
I assure you, however, that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch. " "Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get all these facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular." "Ah, that is good luck.
I could only say what was the balance of probability. I did not at all expect to be so accurate." "But it was not mere guesswork?"
"No, no; I never guess. It is a shocking habit destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend.
For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dented in two places, but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man.
Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects." I nodded to show that I followed his reasoning. "It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed.
There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge.
Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate which contains the keyhole. Look at the thousands of scratches all around the hole marks where the key has slipped. What sober man's key could have scored those grooves?
But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them.
He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?" "It is as clear as daylight," I answered. "I regret the injustice which I did you.
I should have had more faith in your marvelous faculty. May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present?"
"None. Hence the cocaine.
I can not live without brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here.
Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world?
See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across dun-colored houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, and existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth." I had opened my mouth to reply to his tirade, when, with a crisp knock, our landlady entered, bearing a card upon a brass salver.
"A young lady for you, sir," she said, addressing my companion. "Miss Mary Morstan," he read. "Hum!
I have no recollection of that name. Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson.
Don't go, doctor. I prefer that you remain. " CHAPTER II The Statement of the Case Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner.
She was a blond young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste. There was, however, a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with a suggestion of limited means. The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and unbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side. Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic.
In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could not but observe that, as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation. "I have come to you, Mr. Holmes," she said, "because you once enabled my employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic complication. She was much impressed by your kindness and skill."
"Mrs. Cecil Forrester," he repeated, thoughtfully. "I believe that I was of some slight service to her. The case, however, as I remember it, was a very simple one." "She did not think so.
But, at least, you can not say the same of mine.
I can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than the situation in which I find myself." Holmes rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened. He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut, hawk-like features. "State your case," said he, in brisk business tones.
I felt that my position was an embarrassing one. "You will, I am sure, excuse me," I said, rising from my chair. To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me. "If your friend," she said, "would be good enough to stay, he might be of inestimable service to me."
I relapsed into my chair. "Briefly," she continued, "the facts are these. My father was an officer in an Indian regiment, who sent me home when I was quite a child. My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England.
I was placed, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age. In the year 1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve months' leave and came home. He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the Langham Hotel as his address. His message, as I remember, was full of kindness and love. On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone out the night before and had not returned.
I waited all day without news of him. That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the papers. Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father. He came home, with his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and instead " She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short the sentence.
"The date?" asked Holmes, opening his note-book. "He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878 nearly ten years ago."
"His luggage?"
"Remained at the hotel. There was nothing in it to suggest a clue some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands. He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict guard there.
" "Had he any friends in town?"
"Only one that we know of Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the Thirty-fourth Bombay Infantry. The major had retired some little time before, and lived at Upper Norwood. We communicated with him, of course, but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England."
"A singular case," remarked Holmes. "I have not yet described to you the most singular part. About six years ago to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882 an advertisement appeared in the 'Times' asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan, and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward.
There was no name or address appended. I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess. By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column. The same day there arrived through the post a small card-box addressed to me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl. No word of writing was enclosed.
Since then, every year upon the same date, there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl, without any clue as to the sender. They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value. You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome." She opened a flat box as she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen. "Your statement is most interesting," said Sherlock Holmes.
"Has anything else occurred to you?" "Yes; and no later than to-day.
That is why I have come to you. This morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself." "Thank you," said Holmes. "The envelope, too, please.
Postmark, London, S.W., date, July 7.
Hum!
Man's thumb-mark on corner probably postman.
Best quality paper.
Envelopes at sixpence a packet. Particular man in his stationery.
No address.
'Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock.
If you are distrustful, bring two friends. You are a wronged woman, and shall have justice. Do not bring police.
If you do, all will be in vain. Your unknown friend.' Well, really, this is a very pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?" "That is exactly what I want to ask you. " "Then we shall most certainly go. You and I and yes, why, Doctor Watson is the very man.
Your correspondent says two friends. He and I have worked together before." "But would he come?"
she asked, with something appealing in her voice and expression.
"I should be proud and happy," said I, fervently, "if I can be of any service." "You are both very kind," she answered. "I have led a retired life, and have no friends whom I could appeal to. If I am here at six it will do, I suppose?"
"You must not be later," said Holmes. "There is one other point, however. Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses?"
"I have them here," she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of paper. "You are certainly a model client.
You have the correct intuition. Let us see, now." He spread out the papers upon the table and gave little darting glances from one to the other. "They are disguised hands, except the letter," he said, presently, "but there can be no question as to the authorship.
See how the irrepressible Greek ε will break out, and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?"
"Nothing could be more unlike. " "I expected to hear you say so.
We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then."
"Au revoir," said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away.
Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd. "What a very attractive woman!"
I exclaimed, turning to my companion. He had lighted his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. "Is she?" he said, languidly. "I did not observe.
" "You really are an automaton a calculating-machine!" I cried. "There is something positively inhuman in you at times. " He smiled gently.
"It is of the first importance," he said, "not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance money, and the most repellent man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor. " "In this case, however " "I never make exceptions.
An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow's scribble?"
"It is legible and regular," I answered.
"A man of business habits and some force of character.
" Holmes shook his head. "Look at his long letters," he said. "They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write.
There is vacillation in his k's and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.' I shall be back in an hour.
" I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology.
What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things?
She was a unit, a factor nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the imagination. CHAPTER III In Quest of a Solution It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.
"There is no great mystery in this matter," he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him. "The facts appear to admit of only one explanation." "What!
you have solved it already?"
"Well, that will be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all.
It is, however, very suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the 'Times,' that Major Sholto of Upper Norwood, late of the Thirty-fourth Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882."
"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests. " "No?
You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then.
Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death, Captain Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman.
What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the mystery, and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?" "But what a strange compensation!
And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive.
There is no other injustice in her case that you know of." "There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties," said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. "But our expedition of to-night will solve them all.
Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour." I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought our night's work might be a serious one.
Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her. "Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's," she said.
"His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's desk which no one can understand. I don't suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me.
It is here." Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens. "It is paper of native Indian manufacture," he remarked.
"It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building, with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic, like four crosses in a line with their arms touching.
Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, 'The sign of the four Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter! Yet it is evidently a document of importance.
It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other." "It was in his pocket-book that we found it." "Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed.
I must reconsider my ideas." He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey. It was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense, drizzling fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets.
Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was to my mind something eery and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.
Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan's manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences.
He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern. At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women.
We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man, in the dress of a coachman, accosted us.
"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?" he asked. "I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends," said she. He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. "You will excuse me, miss," he said, with a certain dogged manner, "but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police officer."
"I give you my word on that," she answered. He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler, and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside.
We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets. The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand.
Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax, which was an inconceivable hypothesis, or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey.
Miss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barreled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way.
Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets. "Rochester Row," said he. "Now Vincent Square.
Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge.
You can catch glimpses of the river." We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames, with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side. "Wordsworth Road," said my companion. "Priory Road.
Lark Hall Lane.
Stockwell Place.
Robert Street.
Cold Harbor Lane.
Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions." We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public-houses at the corner.
Then came rows of two-storied villas, each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses was inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindu servant clad in a yellow turban, white, loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash.
There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace doorway of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house. "The sahib awaits you," said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. "Show them in to me, khitmutgar," it cried. "Show them straight in to me." CHAPTER IV The Story of the Bald-Headed Man We followed the Indian down the sordid and common passage, ill-lighted and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open.
A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp, which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He rubbed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact, he had just turned his thirtieth year.
"Your servant, Miss Morstan," he kept repeating in a thin, high voice. "Your servant, gentlemen.
Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London." We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us.
In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and draperies draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber and black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss.
Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor. "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto," said the little man, still jerking and smiling. "That is my name.
You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen " "This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this Doctor Watson. " "A doctor, eh?" cried he, much excited.
"Have you your stethoscope? Might I ask you would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral."
I listened to his heart as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. "It appears to be normal," I said. "You have no cause for uneasiness." "You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan," he remarked, airily.
"I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now." I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and offhand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips.
"I knew in my heart that he was dead," said she. "I can give you every information," said he, "and what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to brother Bartholomew.
But let us have no outsiders no police or officials.
We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy brother Bartholomew more than any publicity." He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes. "For my part," said Holmes, "whatever you may choose to say will go no further."
I nodded to show my agreement. "That is well! That is well!" said he. "May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? or of Tokay?
I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No?
Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild, balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative." He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water.
We sat all three in a semicircle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre. "When I first determined to make this communication to you," said he, "I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and, I might even say, refined tastes, and there is nothing more unesthetic than a policeman.
I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me.
I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there can not be the least question about the Bouguereau.
I am partial to the modern French school. " "You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto," said Miss Morstan, "but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible."
"At the best it must take some time," he answered; "for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see brother Bartholomew. We shall all go and try if we can get the better of brother Bartholomew. He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.
I had quite high words with him last night. You can not imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry."
"If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once," I ventured to remark. He laughed until his ears were quite red.
"That would hardly do," he cried. "I don't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way. No; I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant.
I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself. "My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants.
With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children. "I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers, and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussed the case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened.
Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan. "We did know, however, that some mystery some positive danger overhung our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge.
Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once a light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders.
We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have since led us to change our opinion. "Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death.
What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and toward the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us. "When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed.
Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall try and give it to you in his own very words. "'I have only one thing,' he said, 'which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment.
It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself so blind and foolish a thing is avarice.
The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet tipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure.
But send her nothing not even the chaplet until I am gone.
After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered. "'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he continued. ' He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one.
I alone knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he came straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is now dead.
Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backward, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.
"'For a long time I sat half-distracted, wondering what I should do. My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me.
Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know.
"'I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in, and bolted the door behind him. "Do not fear, sahib," he said.
"No one need know that you have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?"
"I did not kill him," said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head, and smiled. "I heard it all, sahib," said he. "I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow.
But my lips are sealed.
All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away together." That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box?
Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.
You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed, not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution.
Put your ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in ' At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out! For Christ's sake, keep him out!' We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass.
It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild, cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed toward the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father, his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.
"We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face.
We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all around us. The window of my father's room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper with the words, 'The sign of the four' scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew.
As far as we can judge, none of my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us." The little man stopped to relight his hookah, and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father's death Miss Morstan had turned deathly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint.
She rallied, however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn over his glittering eyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here, at least, was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost.
Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe: "My brother and I;" said he, "were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died.
We could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father's fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip, and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that, at least, she might never feel destitute."
"It was a kindly thought," said our companion, earnestly. "It was extremely good of you." The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. "We were your trustees," he said. "That was the view which I took of it, though brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light.
We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. 'Le mauvais gout mene au crime.' The French have a very neat way of putting these things.
Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself; so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learned that an event of extreme importance had occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. I explained my views last night to brother Bartholomew; so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.
" Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee. We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to spring to his feet. "You have done well, sir, from first to last," said he. "It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you.
But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.
" Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged top-coat with astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face. "My health is somewhat fragile," he remarked, as he led the way down the passage. "I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.
" Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our program was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace. Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels. "Bartholomew is a clever fellow," said he.
"How do you think he found out where the treasure was?
He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors; so he worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath and plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one.
In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling."
At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance.
He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in larger doses as a sedative.
However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.
"This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge," said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out. CHAPTER V The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night's adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts.
It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way. Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow, iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat. "Who is there?" cried a gruff voice from within.
"It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time." There was a grumbling sound, and a clanking and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling, distrustful eyes. "That you, Mr. Thaddeus?
But who are the others?
I had no orders about them from the master."
"No, McMurdo?
You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends. " "He hain't been out o' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations.
I can let you in; but your friends they must just stop where they are." This was an unexpected obstacle! Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner. "This is too bad of you, McMurdo!"
he said. "If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is a young lady, too. She can not wait on the public road at this hour."
"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus," said the porter, inexorably.
"Folk may be friends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's. He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I'll do. I don't know none o' your friends." "Oh, yes, you do, McMurdo," cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. "I don't think you can have forgotten me.
Don't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?" "Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes?" roared the prize-fighter. "God's truth!
how could I have mistook you? If, instead o' standin' there so quiet, you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I'd ha' known you without a question. Ah, you're one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy."
"You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me," said Holmes, laughing. "Our friend won't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure."
"In you come, sir; in you come you and your friends," he answered. "Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict.
Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in." Inside a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart.
Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand. "I can not understand it," he said. "There must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window.
I do not know what to make of it."
"Does he always guard the premises in this way?" asked Holmes. "Yes; he has followed my father's custom. He was the favorite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew's window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think."
"None," said Holmes. "But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door." "Ah, that is the housekeeper's room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits.
She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together, and she has had no word of our coming, she may be alarmed.
But hush!
what is that?" He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears.
From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman. "It is Mrs. Bernstone," said Sholto. "She is the only woman in the house. Wait here, I shall be back in a moment." He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way.
We could see a tall old woman admit him and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him. "Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!"
We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone. Our guide had left us the lantern.
Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marveled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.
"What a strange place!"
she said, looking round. "It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work." "And from the same cause," said Holmes.
"These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.
" At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes. "There is something amiss with Bartholomew!" he cried. "I am frightened! My nerves can not stand it."
He was, indeed, half-blubbering with fear, and his twitching, feeble face, peeping out from the great astrakhan collar, had the helpless, appealing expression of a terrified child. "Come into the house," said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way. "Yes, do!" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. "I really do not feel equal to giving directions." We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage.
The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless, picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her. "God bless your sweet calm face!"
she cried, with a hysterical sob. "It does me good to see you.
Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!" Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly, womanly comfort which brought the color back into the other's bloodless cheeks. "Master has locked himself in and will not answer me," she explained.
"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the keyhole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face on him as that. " Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him.
Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoanut matting which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp low, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper. The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backward down the corridor.
The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it.
The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath. "There is something devilish in this, Watson," said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. "What do you make of it?"
I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.
The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which, in that still and moonlit room, was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins. "This is terrible!
" I said to Holmes. "What is to be done?"
"The door must come down," he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield.
Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto's chamber. It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.
One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.
By the table, in a wooden armchair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion.
By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me.
"You see," he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows. In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, "The sign of the four." "In God's name, what does it all mean?"
I asked. "It means murder," said he, stooping over the dead man. "Ah, I expected it.
Look here!"
He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear. "It looks like a thorn," said I. "It is a thorn. You may pick it out.
But be careful, for it is poisoned.
" I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been. "This is all an insoluble mystery to me," said I. "It grows darker instead of clearer."
"On the contrary," he answered, "it clears every instant. I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case. " We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the chamber. He was still standing in the doorway, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself.
Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry. "The treasure is gone!"
he said. "They have robbed him of the treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it!
I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came downstairs." "What time was that?" "It was ten o'clock.
And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen?
Surely you don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear!
oh, dear!
I know that I shall go mad!" He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy. "You have no reason to fear, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder.
"Take my advice, and drive down to the station and report the matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return. " The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark. CHAPTER VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration "Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hour to ourselves.
Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of overconfidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it." "Simple!"
I ejaculated.
"Surely," said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class. "Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folks come, and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night.
How of the window?"
He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. "Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side.
Let us open it. No water-pipe near it.
Roof quite out of reach.
Yet a man has mounted by the window.
It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mold upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table.
See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration." I looked at the round, well-defined, muddy disks. "This is not a footmark," said I. "It is something much more valuable to us.
It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with a broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe. " "It is the wooden-legged man." "Quite so.
But there has been some one else a very able and efficient ally.
Could you scale that wall, doctor?" I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work.
"It is absolutely impossible," I answered. "Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall.
Then, I think, if you were an active man you might climb up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted," he continued, fingering the rope, "that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor.
His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially toward the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hands." "This is all very well," said I, "but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever.
How about this mysterious ally?
How came he into the room?"
"Yes, the ally!" repeated Holmes, pensively. "There are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace.
I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia." "How came he, then?"
I reiterated. "The door is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?" "The grate is much too small," he answered.
"I have already considered that possibility." "How then?"
I persisted. "You will not apply my precept," he said, shaking his head.
"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible.
Where, then, did he come?"
"He came through the hole in the roof," I cried. "Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above the secret room in which the treasure was found.
" He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him. The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath and plaster between them, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house.
There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor. "Here you are, you see," said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall. "This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle.
This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see if we can find some other traces of his individuality. " He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.
For myself, as I followed his gaze, my skin was cold under my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man. "Holmes," I said, in a whisper, "a child has done this horrid thing." He had recovered his self-possession in an instant.
"I was staggered for the moment," he said, "but the thing is quite natural. My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down."
"What is your theory, then, as to those foot-marks?"
I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more. "My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself," said he, with a touch of impatience. "You know my methods. Apply them; and it will be instructive to compare results." "I can not conceive anything which will cover the facts," I answered.
"It will be clear enough to you soon," he said, in an off-hand way. "I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look." He whipped out his lens and a tape-measure, and comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defense. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.
"We are certainly in luck," said he. "We ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the right of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, you see, and the stuff has leaked out."
"What then?"
I asked. "Why, we have got him, that's all," said he. "I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world's end. If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire, how far can a specially trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three.
The answer should give us the  But halloo!
here are the accredited representatives of the law." Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash. "Before they come," said Holmes, "just put your hand here on this poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg.
What do you feel?"
"The muscles are as hard as a board," I answered. "Quite so.
They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual 'rigor mortis.' Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?" "Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid," I answered; "some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus."
"That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned toward the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now examine this thorn.
" I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.
"Is that an English thorn?" he asked. "No, it certainly is not."
"With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.
" As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly, and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto. "Here's a business! " he cried, in a muffled, husky voice.
"Here's a pretty business! But who are all these?
Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren." "I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones," said Holmes quietly. "Why, of course I do!" he wheezed.
"It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes, and inferences, and effects in the Bishopsgate jewel case.
It's true you set us on the right track, but you'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance. " "It was a piece of very simple reasoning." "Oh, come, now, come!
Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this?
Bad business!
Bad business!
Stern facts here no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d'you think the man died of?" "Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over," said Holmes, dryly.
"No, no.
Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me!
Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing.
How was the window?" "Fastened; but there are steps on the sill." "Well, well; if it was fastened, the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That's common sense.
Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha!
I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times. Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto.
Your friend can remain. What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night.
The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How's that?"
"On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside. " "Hum!
There's a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.
This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel; so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know.
No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind.
His appearance is well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him." "You are not quite in possession of the facts yet," said Holmes.
"This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all this fit into your theory?" "Confirms it in every respect," said the fat detective, pompously.
"House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus a blind, as like as not. The only question is, How did he depart?
Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.
" With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterward we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trapdoor. "He can find something," remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. "He has occasional glimmerings of reason.
I'l n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!"
"You see!" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again. "Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is partly open. " "It was I who opened it."
"Oh, indeed!
You did notice it, then?" He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. "Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away.
Inspector!"
"Yes, sir," from the passage.
"Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way. Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your brother." "There, now!
Didn't I tell you?" cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us. "Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes.
"I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge." "Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist don't promise too much!" snapped the detective. "You may find it a harder matter than you think." "Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in the room last night.
His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly educated man; small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict.
These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man " "Ah!
the other man?" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other's manner. "Is a rather curious person," said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel.
"I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them. A word with you, Watson.
" He led me out to the head of the stair. "This unexpected occurrence," he said, "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey." "I have just been thinking so," I answered. "It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house."
"No.
You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell; so it is not very far. I will wait for you here, if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?"
"By no means.
I don't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far."
"Your presence will be of great service to me," he answered. "We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct.
When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the water's edge, at Lambeth.
The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer's; Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Rouse old Sherman up, and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you."
"A dog, I suppose?"
"Yes, a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent.
I would rather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of London." "I shall bring him, then," said I. "It is one now. I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.
" "And I," said Holmes, "shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tells me, sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones's methods, and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. ' Wir sind gewohnt, dass die Menschen verhohnen was sie nicht verstehen.' Goethe is always pithy."
CHAPTER VII The Episode of the Barrel The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping, so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night.
She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences.
Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips.
She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still she was rich. If Holmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress.
Was it fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind.
This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us. It was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received, that she had sat up in the hope of her return.
She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other's waist, and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependent, but an honored friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and to tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case.
As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us. And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent, gas-lighted streets.
There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair at ever finding the clue.
Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make any impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.
"Go on, you drunken vagabond!" said the face. "If you kick up any more row I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs at you." "If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for," said I.  "Go on!" yelled the voice. "So help me gracious, I have a wiper in this bag, an' I'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't book it!" "But I want a dog," I cried.
"I won't be argued with!" shouted Mr. Sherman. "Now stand clear; for when I say 'three,' down goes the wiper. " "Mr. Sherlock Holmes " I began; but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses. "A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome," said he.
"Step in, sir.  Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty!
would you take a nip at the gentleman?" This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage.
"Don't mind that, sir; it's only a slow-worm. It hain't got no fangs, so I gives it the run o' the room, for it keeps the beetles down.
You must not mind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyed by the children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to rouse me up. What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?"  "He wanted a dog of yours. " "Ah! that would be Toby." "Yes, Toby was the name." "Toby lives at No. 7, on the left here.
" He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the Other as our voices disturbed their slumbers. Toby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown and white in color, with a very clumsy waddling gait.
It accepted, after some hesitation, a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter, McMurdo, had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station.
Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective's name. Holmes was standing on the doorstep, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe. "Ah, you have him there!" said he. "Good dog, then!
Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left.
He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves but for a sergeant upstairs. Leave the dog here and come up." We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs. The room was as we had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure.
A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner. "Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant," said my companion. "Now tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me.
Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings. Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing.
And dip my handkerchief into the creosote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment." We clambered up through the hole.
Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust. "I wish particularly to notice these foot-marks," he said. "Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?"
"They belong," I said, "to a child or a small woman. " "Apart from their size, though.  Is there nothing else?"
"They appear to be much as other foot-marks." "Not at all.  Look here!
This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?"  "Your toes are all cramped together.
The other print has each toe distinctly divided." "Quite so.
That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the woodwork?
I shall stay over here as I have this handkerchief in my hand." I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell.
"That is where he put his foot in getting out. If you can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run downstairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin." By the time that I got out into the grounds, Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glowworm crawling very slowly along the ridge.
I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves. "That you, Watson?" he cried. "Yes."  "This is the place. What is that black thing down there?'  "A water-barrel.
" "Top on it?"  "Yes."
"No sign of a ladder?"  "No."  "Confound the fellow!
It's a most break-neck place, I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm. Here goes, anyhow." There was a shuffling of the feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall.
Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth. "It was easy to follow him," he said, drawing on his stockings and boots. "Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this.
It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it."
The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.
"They are hellish things," said he. "Look out that you don't prick yourself. I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long.
I would sooner face a Martini bullet myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?"  "Certainly," I answered. "Your leg will stand it?"
"Oh, yes." "Here you are, doggy!
Good old Toby!
Smell it, Toby; smell it!" He pushed the creosote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him to the foot of the water-barrel.
The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed. The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold, gray light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.
On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side.
"There's the print of wooden-leg's hand," he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. "You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday!
The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours' start." I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creosote rose high above all other contending scents.
"Do not imagine," said Holmes, "that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest, and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it.
It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it but for this too palpable clue. " "There is credit, and to spare," said I. "I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable.
How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?"  "Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don't wish to be theatrical.
It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan's possession.
He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers or one of them gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself?
The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away." "But this is mere speculation," said I.  "It is more than that.
It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?"
"A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free. " "Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him.
What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man's name is on the chart.
The others are Hindus or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty?"
"No; it is clear and concise."
"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small.
Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house.
There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died.
Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a memento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card.
He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?" "Very clearly."
"Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure.
Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto.
He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creosote, whence come Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis. " "But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime. " "Quite so.
And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged.
He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however; the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work; so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them.
Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don't know that there is anything else."
"The associate?"  "Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that.
But you will know all about it soon enough.
How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who is on a stranger errand than you and I.  How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?"  "Fairly so.
I worked back to him through Carlyle." "That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of a man's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation, which is in itself a proof of nobility.
There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?" "I have my stick." "It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair.
Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead." He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket. We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural, villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where laborers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing doorsteps. At the square-topped corner public-house business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet.
Strange dogs sauntered up, and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onward with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine, which spoke of a hot scent. We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side street would serve their turn.
At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backward and forward with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment. "What the deuce is the matter with the dog?" growled Holmes.
"They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon." "Perhaps they stood here for some time," I suggested. "Ah!
it's all right. He's off again," said my companion, in a tone of relief.
He was indeed off; for, after sniffing round again, he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash, and tried to break into a run. I could see by the gleam in Holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey. Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern.
Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprung upon a large barrel, which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creosote.
Sherlock Holmes and I looked at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. CHAPTER VIII  The Baker Street Irregulars  "What now?
" I asked. "Toby has lost his character for infallibility." "He acted according to his lights," said Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. "If you consider how much creosote is carried about London in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed.
It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame." "We must get on the main scent again, I suppose." "Yes.  And, fortunately, we have no distance to go.
Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other."
There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle, and finally dashed off in a fresh direction. "We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creosote barrel came from," I observed.
"I had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway.
No, we are on the true scent now." It tended down toward the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince's Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond.
"We are out of luck," said Holmes. "They have taken to a boat here." Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water on the edge of the wharf.
We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign. Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. "Mordecai Smith" was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, "Boats to hire by the hour or day."
A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly around, and his face assumed an ominous expression. "This looks bad," said he. "These fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks.
There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here. " He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman, with a large sponge in her hand. "You come back and be washed, Jack!" she shouted.
"Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he'll let us hear of it!"
"Dear little chap!" said Holmes, strategically, "What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?" The youth pondered for a moment.
"I'd like a shillin'," said he. "Nothing you would like better?"  "I'd like two shillin' better," the prodigy answered, after some thought. "Here you are, then!
Catch! A fine child, Mrs. Smith.
" "Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a'most too much for me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a time." "Away, is he?" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. "I am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.
" "He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginning to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well."
"I wanted to hire his steam launch.
" "Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. That's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he'd been away in the barge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha' stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?"  "He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.
" "He might, sir, but it weren't his way. Many a time I've heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don't like that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin' about here for?"  "A wooden-legged man?" said Holmes, with bland surprise.
"Yes, sir; a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and what's more, my man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it."
"But, my dear Mrs. Smith," said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, "you are frightening yourself about nothing.
How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don't quite understand how you can be so sure."
"His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy.
He tapped at the winder about three it would be. ' Show a leg, matey,' says he; 'time to turn out guard.' My old man woke Jim up that's my eldest and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones.
" "And was this wooden-legged man alone?"  "Couldn't say, I am sure, sir. I didn't hear no one else. " "I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard good reports of the   Let me see, what is her name?"
"The 'Aurora,' sir."
"Ah! She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in the beam?"
"No, indeed.
She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. She's been fresh painted, black with two red streaks." "Thanks.
I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going down the river; and if I should see anything of the 'Aurora' I shall let him know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?"
"No, sir.
Black with a white band.
" "Ah, of course.
It was the sides which were black. Good morning, Mrs. Smith.
There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it and cross the river." "The main thing with people of that sort," said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, "is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you.
If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want." "Our course now seems pretty clear," said I.  "What would you do then?" "I would engage a launch and go down the track of the 'Aurora.'"  "My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task.
She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone." "Employ the police then."
"No.  I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally.
But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.
" "Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?"  "Worse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. Jones's energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent."
"What are we to do then?"
I asked, as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary. "Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour's sleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again.
Stop at a telegraph office, cabby. We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet." We pulled up at the Great Peter Street Post-office, and Holmes despatched his wire. "Whom do you think that is to?" he asked, as we resumed our journey. "I am sure I don't know.
" "You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?"  "Well," said I, laughing. "This is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first.
That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast. " It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderer.
The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it, I was ready to devote my life to the one object.
True, if I found it, it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that.
If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure. A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee. "Here it is," said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper. "The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them.
But you have had enough of the case.
Better have your ham and eggs first." I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed "Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood." "About twelve o'clock last night," said the "Standard," "Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems, which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father, has been carried off.
The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed toward the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo.
It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We can not but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.
" "Isn't it gorgeous!" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. "What do you think of it?" "I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.
" "So do I.  I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy." At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay. "By heaven, Holmes," I said, half-rising, "I believe they are really after us." "No, it's not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force the Baker Street irregulars.
" As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street Arabs. There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow. "Got your message, sir," said he, "and brought 'em in sharp.
Three bob and a tanner for tickets.
" "Here you are," said Holmes, producing some silver, "In future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I can not have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions.
I want to find the whereabout of a steam launch called the 'Aurora,' owner, Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage, opposite Millbank, to say if the boat comes back.
You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have the news. Is that all clear?"
"Yes, guv'nor," said Wiggins. "The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here's a day in advance. Now off you go!"
He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street. "If the launch is above water they will find her," said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lighted his pipe. "They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one.
I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. In the meanwhile, we can do nothing but await results. We can not pick up the broken trail until we find either the 'Aurora' or Mr. Mordecai Smith. " "Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say.
Are you going to bed, Holmes?" "No; I am not tired. I have a curious constitution.
I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke, and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be.
Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique." "That other man again!"
"I have no wish to make a mystery of him to you, anyway. But you must have formed your own opinion.
Now, do consider the data. Diminutive foot-marks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small, poisoned darts. What do you make of all this?"  "A savage!"
I exclaimed. "Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small. " "Hardly that," said he. "When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so, but the remarkable character of the foot-marks caused me to reconsider my views.
Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They were from a blow-pipe.
Now, then, where are we to find our savage?"  "South America," I hazarded. He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf. "This is the first volume of a gazeteer which is now being published.
It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here?  'Andaman Islands, situated three hundred and forty miles to the north of Sumatra in the Bay of Bengal.'  Hum! hum! What's all this?
'Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods ' Ah, here we are.
' The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.' Mark that, Watson.
Now, then, listen to this: 'They are naturally hideous, having large misshapen heads, small fierce eyes, and distorted features.
Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British officials have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.' Nice, amiable people, Watson!
If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him." "But how came he to have so singular a companion?"  "Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him.
No doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look here, Watson, you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep." He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvization.
I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow. Then I seemed to be floating peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dreamland, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me. CHAPTER IX  A Break in the Chain It was late in the afternoon before I awoke, strengthened and refreshed. Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book.
He looked across at me as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled. "You have slept soundly," he said. "I feared that our talk would wake you." "I heard nothing," I answered. "Have you had fresh news, then?"
"Unfortunately, no.
I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.
" "Can I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night's outing." "No; we can do nothing.
We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard." "Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester.
She asked me to yesterday." "On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes. "Well, of course, on Miss Morstan, too.
They were anxious to hear what happened." "I would not tell them too much," said Holmes.
"Women are never to be entirely trusted not the best of them." I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. "I shall be back in an hour or two," I remarked. "All right!
Good luck!
But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don't think it at all likely that we shall have any use for him now."
I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane.
At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.
With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them. "It is a romance!" cried Mrs. Forrester. "An injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian.
They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl." "And two knights errant to the rescue," added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me. "Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don't think that you are nearly excited enough.
Just imagine what it must be to be so rich and to have the world at your feet. " It sent a thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest. "It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious," she said.
"Nothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge." It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home.
My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none. "I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out," I said to Mrs. Hudson, as she came up to lower the blinds. "No, sir.
He has gone to his room, sir.
Do you know, sir," sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, "I am afraid for his health!" "Why so, Mrs. Hudson?"  "Well, he's that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked, and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep.
Then I heard him talking to himself, and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with, 'What is that, Mrs. Hudson?' And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he's not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how I ever got out of the room." "I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson," I answered.
"I have seen him like this before. He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless." I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still, from time to time, heard the dull sound of his tread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction. At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek. "You are knocking yourself up, old man," I remarked.
"I heard you marching about in the night." "No, I could not sleep," he answered. "This infernal problem is consuming me.
It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used every means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband.
I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.
" "Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent." "No, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.
" "Could it have gone up the river?"  "I have considered that possibility, too, and there is a search party who will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear something.
" We did not, however. Not a word came to us, either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy.
They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose.
He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes, which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment. In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress, with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck.
"I am off down the river, Watson," said he. "I have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events. " "Surely I can come with you, then?" said I.  "No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loth to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night.
I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and act on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?" "Most certainly."
"I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long.
I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back." I heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the "Standard," however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business. "With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy," it remarked, "we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter.
He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment."
"That is satisfactory so far as it goes," thought I.  "Friend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder. " I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column.
It ran in this way:   "Lost. Whereas, Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son Jim, left Smith's Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning, in the steam launch 'Aurora,' black with two red stripes; funnel black with a white band; the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 222B Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch 'Aurora.'" This was clearly Holmes's doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.
It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing.
Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning? Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived.
He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the overrefinement of his logic his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions.
When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outré and startling. At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common-sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic. "Good-day, sir; good-day," said he.
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand." "Yes; and I can not be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait.
Take that chair and try one of these cigars." "Thank you; I don't mind if I do," said he, mopping his face with a red bandana handkerchief. "And a whisky and soda?"  "Well, half a glass.
It is very hot for the time of year and I have a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case?"  "I remember that you expressed one." "Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it.
I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop!
he went through a hole in the middle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over the roofs and through trap-doors. It's a very dark case and my professional credit is at stake.
I should be very glad of a little assistance." "We all need help sometimes," said I.  "Your friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, is a wonderful man, sir," said he, in a husky and confidential voice. "He's a man who is not to be beat. I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw light upon.
He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick, perhaps, in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I don't care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is his message. " He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me.
It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock. "Go to Baker Street at once," it said. "If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish."
"This sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again," said I.  "Ah, then he has been at fault, too," exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. "Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes.
Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door.
Perhaps this is he." A heavy step was heard ascending the stairs, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat.
His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.
"What is it, my man?" I asked. He looked about him in the slow, methodical fashion of old age. "Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?" said he. "No; but I am acting for him.
You can tell me any message you have for him."
"It was to him himself I was to tell it," said he. "But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith's boat?"
"Yes. I knows well where it is.
An' I knows where the men he is after are. An' I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it." "Then tell me, and I shall let him know. " "It was to him I was to tell it," he repeated, with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man.
"Well, you must wait for him." "No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr. Holmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I don't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word."
He shuffled toward the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him. "Wait a bit, my friend," said he. "You have important information, and you must not walk off.
We shall keep you, whether you like it or not, until our friend returns." The old man made a little run toward the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessness of resistance. "Pretty sort o' treatment this!"
he cried, stamping his stick. "I come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!" "You will be none the worse," I said.
"We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait." He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.
Suddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us. "I think that you might offer me a cigar, too," he said. We both started in our chairs.
There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement. "Holmes!"
I exclaimed. "You here?
But where is the old man?"  "Here is the old man," said he, holding out a heap of white hair. "Here he is wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all.
I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test." "Ah, you rogue!" cried Jones, highly delighted. "You would have made an actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week.
I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though. You didn't get away from us so easily, you see." "I have been working in that get-up all day," said he, lighting his cigar.
"You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases; so I can only go on the warpath under some simple disguise like this. You got my wire?"
"Yes; that was what brought me here." "How has your case prospered?" "It has all come to nothing.
I had to release two of my prisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two." "Never mind. We shall give you two others in place of them. But you must put yourself under my orders.
You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the lines that I point out. Is that agreed?" "Entirely, if you will help me to the men. " "Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat a steam launch to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock.
" "That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I can step across the road and telephone, to make sure." "Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance. " "There will be two or three in the boat.
What else?"
"When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first to open it.
Eh, Watson?"
"It would be a great pleasure to me." "Rather an irregular proceeding," said Jones, shaking his head. "However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at it. The treasure must afterward be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.
" "Certainly.
That is easily managed. One other point.
I should much like to have the details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?" "Well, you are master of the situation.
I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don't see how I can refuse you an interview with him."
"That is understood, then?"  "Perfectly.  Is there anything else?"
"Only that I insist upon your dining with us.
It will be ready in half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wine. Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper. " CHAPTER X  The End of the Islander  Our meal was a merry one. Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose.
He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the warships of the future handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant.
For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's gaiety. None of us alluded during the dinner to the cause which had brought us together. When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up three glasses with port.
"One bumper," said he, "to the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?"  "I have my old service-revolver in my desk. " "You had best take it, then.
It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six."
It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us.
Holmes eyed it critically. "Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?" "Yes that green lamp at the side.
" "Then take it off. " The small change was made; we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.
"Where to?" asked Jones. "To the Tower.
Tell them to stop opposite to Jacobson's Yard." Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us. "We ought to be able to catch anything on the river," he said.
"Well, hardly that.
But there are not many launches to beat us.
" "We shall have to catch the 'Aurora,' and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?" "Yes."
"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis.
One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result.
The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed.
I knew that this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge he could hardly leave at a moment's notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate. " "It seemed to me to be a little weak," said I.
"It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition." "No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it.
But a second consideration struck me: Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy.
He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their headquarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat.
It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under the cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies."
"But the launch?
They could not have taken that to their lodgings.'"  "Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track.
How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might hand the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with the directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours' notice."
"That seems simple enough." "It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea.
I started at once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth Jacobson's I learned that the 'Aurora' had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder.  ' There ain't naught amiss with her rudder,' said the foreman. ' There she lies, with the red streaks.' At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner. He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch.
'I want her to-night at eight o'clock,' said he 'eight o'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting.' They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an alehouse; so I went back into the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at the water's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start.
We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all." "You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not," said Jones; "but if the affair were in my hands, I should have had a body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came down." "Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious, he would lie snug for another week."
"But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place," said I.  "In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions?
They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best. " While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames.
As we passed the city the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul's. It was twilight before we reached the Tower. "That is Jacobson's Yard," said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side. "Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters." He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore.
"I see my sentry at his post," he remarked, "but no sign of a handkerchief." "Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them," said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policeman and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward. "We have no right to take anything for granted," Holmes answered.
"It is certainly ten to one that they go downstream, but we can not be certain. From this point we can see the entrance to the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light.
We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gas-light." "They are coming from work in the yard. " "Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him.
You would not think it, to look at them. There is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma is man!"
"Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal," I suggested.
"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject," said Holmes. "He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician.
But do I see a handkerchief?
Surely there is a white flutter over yonder." "Yes; it is your boy," I cried. "I can see him plainly." "And there is the 'Aurora,'" exclaimed Holmes, "and going like the devil!
Full speed ahead, engineer.
Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!" She had slipped unseen through the yard entrance, and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her.
Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head. "She is very fast," he said. "I doubt if we shall catch her."  "We must catch her!" cried Holmes, between his teeth. "Heap it on, stokers!
Make her do all she can!
If we burn the boat we must have them!" We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked like a great metallic heart. Her sharp, steep prow cut through the still river water, and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines she sprung and quivered like a living thing.
One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the "Aurora" lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other.
Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the "Aurora" thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track. "Pile it on, men; pile it on!" cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can."
"I think we gain a little," said Jones, with his eyes on the "Aurora. " "I am sure of it," said I.  "We shall be up with her in a very few minutes. " At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the "Aurora" had gained a good two hundred yards.
She was still, however, well in view, and the murky, uncertain twilight was settling into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty "Aurora.
" Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees, over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shoveling coal for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now, as we followed every winding and turning which they took, there could no longer be any question about it.
At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them yard by yard.
In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop.
We were not more than four boats' lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprung up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and, as he stood poising himself with legs astride, I could see that from the thigh downward there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was a movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck.
It straightened itself into a little black man the smallest I have ever seen with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, disheveled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half-animal fury.
"Fire if he raises his hand," said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf, with his hideous face, and his strong, yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern. It was well that we had so clear a view of him.
Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters.
At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation.
The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprung out, but his stump instantly sunk its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed.
Not one step could he possibly take either forward or backward. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side.
The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The "Aurora" herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos.
There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our searchlight in every direction, but there was no sign of the islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores. "See here," said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. "We were hardly quick enough, with our pistols."
There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired. Holmes smiled at it, and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night. CHAPTER XI  The Great Agra Treasure  Our captive sat in the cabin opposite the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life.
There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or thereabout, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His face, in repose, was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.
It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humor in his eyes. "Well, Jonathan Small," said Holmes, lighting a cigar, "I am sorry that it has come to this. " "And so am I, sir," he answered, frankly.
"I don't believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the Book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound, Tonga, who shot one of his cursed darts into him.
I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again."  "Have a cigar," said Holmes; "and you had better take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?" "You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir.
The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defense that I can make is just the simple truth.
Now, if it had been the old major, I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.
" "You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you.
I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before you ever reached the room." "That he was, sir!
I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half-killed Tonga for it, if he had not scrambled off.
That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts, too, as he tells me, which, I dare say, helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing," he added, with a bitter smile, "that I, who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money, should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am likely to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor.
It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet, and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder; to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt; to me it has meant slavery for life." At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. "Quite a family party," he remarked.
"I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine.
It was all we could do to overhaul her."
"All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did not know that the 'Aurora' was such a clipper." "Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business. " "Neither he did," cried our prisoner; "not a word.
I chose his launch, because I heard that she was a flyer. We told him nothing, but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the 'Esmeralda,' at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils." "Well, if he has done no wrong, we shall see that no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them. " It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture.
From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him. "We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently," said Jones, "and shall land you, Doctor Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but, of course, an agreement is an agreement.
I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?"
"Yes, I shall drive. " "It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first.
You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?" "At the bottom of the river," said Small, shortly. "Hum!
There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you.
However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful.
Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station." They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion.
A quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room; so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab. She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white, diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet in the neck and waist.
The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket-chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair; one white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my footfall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks. "I heard a cab drive up," she said.
"I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamt that it might be you. What news have you brought me?" "I have brought something better than news," said I, putting down the box upon the table, and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me.
"I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune." She glanced at the iron box.
"Is that the treasure, then?" she asked, coolly enough. "Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto's.
You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds.
There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?" I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously. "If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you." "No, no," I answered; "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment. " "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Doctor Watson," said she. I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the "Aurora," the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames.
She listened, with parted lips and shining eyes, to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared she was about to faint. "It is nothing," she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. "I am all right again.
It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril."
"That is all over," I answered. "It was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details.
Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it."
"It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said. There was no eagerness in her voice, however. It struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win.
"What a pretty box!"
she said, stooping over it. "This is Indian work, I suppose?"  "Yes; it is Benares metal-work."
"And so heavy!"
she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?"  "Small threw it into the Thames," I answered. "I must borrow Mrs. Forrester's poker."
There was, in the front, a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap.
With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty! No wonder that it was heavy.
The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely empty.
"The treasure is lost," said Miss Morstan, calmly. As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down until now that it was finally removed.
It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us.
"Thank God!" I ejaculated from my very heart. She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. "Why do you say that?" she asked.
"Because you are within my reach again," I said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it. "Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips.
Now that they are gone, I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, 'Thank God.'"  "Then I say, 'Thank God,' too," she whispered, as I drew her to my side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one.
CHAPTER XII  The Strange Story of Jonathan Small  A very patient man was the inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box. "There goes the reward!" said he, gloomily.
"Where there is no money there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me, if the treasure had been there." "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said. "He will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no treasure." The inspector shook his head despondently, however.
"It's a bad job," he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think." His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his armchair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.
"This is your doing, Small," said Athelney Jones, angrily. "Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he cried, exultantly. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I can not have the use of it, and I know that they can not.
I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet.
You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey. " "You are deceiving us, Small," said Athelney Jones, sternly. "If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames, it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all."
"Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover," he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look. "The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though.
I was half-mad when you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it.
I've had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry over spilled milk." "This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial." "Justice?" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice!
Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who had never earned it? Look how I have earned it. Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man.
That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I can not bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine!" Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track. "You forget that we know nothing of all this," said Holmes, quietly.
"We have not heard your story, and we can not tell how far justice may originally have been on your side." "Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that.
It is all fair and above-board. If you want to hear my story, I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is God's truth, every word of it.
Thank you; you can put the glass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry. "I am a Worcestershire man myself born near Pershore. I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover.
At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it by taking the queen's shilling and joining the Third Buffs, which was just starting for India. "I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg, as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee.
What with the shock and loss of blood, I fainted, and should have been drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it, with this timber toe strapped to my stump, I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation. "I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple, though not yet in my twentieth year.
However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise.
A man named Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post, and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep a good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers.
The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home. "Well, I was never in luck's way long.
Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course, you know all about it, gentlemen, a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes.
Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate, with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up.
There he sat on his veranda, drinking whisky-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the bookwork and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half-eaten by jackals and native dogs.
A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand, and four Sepoys lying across one another in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house.
Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sung past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra. "As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees.
Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the crudest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the Third Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery.
A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city. Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture, and murder, and outrage.
"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshipers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort of Agra. I don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort.
It is a very queer place the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres.
There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipeds.
It is all full of great, deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folks to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring. "The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns.
It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organize a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small, isolated door upon the south-west side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard.
As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack. "Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mohammed Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chillianwalla.
They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bhang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream. Every two hours the officers of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well.
"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike a match.
In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and leveled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat, and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step. "My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore.
Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knee at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered: 'Don't make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.' There was the ring Of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man.
I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was they wanted from me. "'Listen to me, sahib,' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. ' You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever.
The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us, on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch, and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way.
Which is it to be, death or life? We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.'  "'How can I decide?' said I.  'You have not told me what you want of me. But I tell you now, that if it is anything against the safety of the fort, I will have no truck with it; so you can drive home your knife, and welcome.' "'It is nothing against the fort,' said he.
'We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.'  "'But what is the treasure, then?' I asked. 'I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.' "'You swear, then,' said he, 'by the bones of your father, by the honor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterward?' "'I will swear it;' I answered, 'provided that the fort is not endangered.' "Then my comrades and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure, which shall be equally divided among the four of us.' "There are but three,' said I.  "'No; Dost Akbar must have his share.
We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mohammed Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindu, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife and your body in the water.
But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh.
Hearken, then, to what I have to say.
"'There is a rajah in the Northern Provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spends it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger with the Sepoy and with the Company's Raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men's day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow.
Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him.
That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered, his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By his doing this, mark you, sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt. "'This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort.
He has with him, as traveling companion, my foster-brother, Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mohammed Singh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming.
The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, sahib?'"  "In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'er-do-weel coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind.
Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely. "'Consider, sahib,' said he, 'that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hanged or shot, and his jewels taken by the Government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers.
There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men. What could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.' "'I am with you heart and soul,' said I.  "'It is well,' he answered, handing me back my firelock. ' You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.' "'Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?' I asked. "'The plan is his. He has devised it.
We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mohammed Singh.' "The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death. "Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat.
It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction. "'Here they are!' I exclaimed. "'You will challenge him, sahib, as usual,' whispered Abdullah. ' Give him no cause for fear.
Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.' "The light had flickered onward, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat.
I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them. "'Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice. "'Friends,' came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them.
The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl.
He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up toward me. "'Your protection, sahib,' he panted; 'your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have traveled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra.
I have been robbed, and beaten, and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety I and my poor possessions.' "'What have you in the bundle?' I asked. "'An iron box,' he answered, 'which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.' "I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man.
The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over. "'Take him to the main guard,' said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gateway. Never was a man so compassed round with death.
I remained at the gateway with the lantern. "I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great, black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand.
I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air, he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my fire-lock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit.
Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay where he had fallen. I think, myself, that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise.
I am telling you every word of this business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favor or not."
He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whisky and water which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded:  "It was all very bad, no doubt," said he.
"I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the whole business would have come to light, and I should have been court-martialed and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that." "Go on with your story," said Holmes, shortly. "Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I.  A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short.
Mohammed Singh was left to guard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks.
This done, we all went back to the treasure. "It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was the same which now lies open upon your table.
A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them.
There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, 'the Great Mogul,' and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cat's-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since.
Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold chaplet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it. "After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mohammed Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret.
We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks, in the best preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure.
We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken. "Well, there is no use my telling you, gentlemen, what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi, and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow, the back of the business was broken.
Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under Colonel Greathead came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered, by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet. "It came about in this way.
When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet, he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however; so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant, and set him to play the spy upon the first. This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow.
He went after him that night, and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered.
Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe, we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India; so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterward commuted into the same as the others. "It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then.
There we were all four tied by the leg, and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time. "At last it seemed to me to have come.
I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island, in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself.
It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There were digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas; so it was a terribly difficult job to get away.
"The surgeon, Doctor Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There were Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there were the surgeon himself, and two or three prison officials, crafty old hands who played a nice, sly, safe game.
A very snug little party they used to make. "Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don't say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow.
Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand, and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.
"One night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart.
The major was raving about his losses. "'It's all up, Morstan,' he was saying, as they passed my hut. 'I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.' "'Nonsense, old chap!' said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. 'I've had a nasty facer myself, but '  That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking. "A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach; so I took the chance of speaking to him.
"'I wish to have your advice, major,' said I.  "'Well, Small, what is it?' he said, taking his cheroot from his lips. "'I wanted to ask you, sir,' said I, 'who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over.
I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I can not use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then, perhaps, they would get my sentence shortened for me.' "'Half a million, Small?' he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest. "'Quite that, sir in jewels and pearls.
It lies there ready for any one. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and can not hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.' "'To government, Small,' he stammered; 'to government.' But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.
"'You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?' said I, quietly. "'Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent. Let me hear all about it, Small.  Give me the facts.' "I told him the whole story, with small changes, so that he could not identify the place.
When I had finished he stood stock-still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him. "'This is a very important matter, Small,' he said, at last. 'You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.' "Two nights later he and his friend, Captain Morstan, came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern. "'I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,' said he.
"I repeated it as I had told it before. "'It rings true, eh?' said he. 'It's good enough to act upon?' Captain Morstan nodded.
"'Look here, Small,' said the major. 'We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter after all, but is a private concern of your own, which, of course, you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it?
We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.' He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed. "'Why, as to that, gentlemen,' I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, 'there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs.
We shall then take you into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you." "'Hum!' said he. 'A fifth share!
That is not very tempting.' "'It would come to fifty thousand apiece,' said I.  "'But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an impossibility.' "'Nothing of the sort,' I answered.
'I have thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over.
We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.' "'If there was only one,' he said. "'None or all,' I answered. 'We have sworn it. The four of us must always act together.' "'You see, Morstan,' said he, 'Small is a man of his word. He does not flinch from his friends. I think we may very well trust him.' "'It's a dirty business,' the other answered. ' Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.' "'Well, Small,' said the major, 'we must, I suppose, try and meet you.
We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.'  "'Not so fast,' said I, growing colder as he got hot. 'I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.' "'Nonsense!' he broke in.
'What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?'  "'Black or blue,' said I, 'they are in with me, and we all go together.' "Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mohammed Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort, and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story.
If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major's share as well as his own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of the four that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mohammed, and myself.
"Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend, Mr. Jones, is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I'll make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail boats very shortly afterward.
His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterward, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night.
It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat that was my one thought Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto. "Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out.
But it was weary years before my time came.
I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day, when Doctor Somerton was down with a fever, a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk.
He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me. "Tonga for that was his name was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own.
When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance to escape. I talked it over with him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoanuts, and sweet potatoes.
"He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf.
As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see.
Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him.
He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough.
I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoanut matting, with which I made a sort of a sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them.
They had one very good quality; they let you alone and asked no questions. "Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose.
I would dream of Sholto at night. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure or if he still had it. I made friends with some one who could help me I name no names, for I don't want to get any one else in a hole and I soon found that he still had the jewels.
Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him. "One day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him. I'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only, even as I looked at him, his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone.
I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however; so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom.
It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled. "We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance; so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day's work.
I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory.
I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how, with my wooden leg, I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga.
I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill-luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little bloodthirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them.
Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come. "I don't know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith's launch, the 'Aurora,' so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship.
He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you for you have not done me a very good turn but it is because I believe the best defense I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son." "A very remarkable account ," said Sherlock Holmes.
"A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case.
There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat. " "He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time." "Ah, of course," said Holmes, "I had not thought of that.
" "Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?" asked the convict, affably. "I think not, thank you," my companion answered. "Well, Holmes," said Athelney Jones, "you are a man to be humored, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key.
The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors downstairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.
" "Good-night, gentlemen both," said Jonathan Small. "You first, Small," remarked the wary Jones as they left the room. "I'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg, whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles." "Well, and there is the end of our little drama," I remarked, after we had sat some time looking in silence. "I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods.
Miss Morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective." He gave a most dismal groan. "I feared as much," said he; "I really can not congratulate you." I was a little hurt. "Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?"
I asked.
"Not at all.
I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She has a decided genius that way; witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things.
I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment." "I trust," said I, laughing, "that my judgment may survive the ordeal. But you look weary.
" "Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag for a week." "Strange," said I, "how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with fits of splendid energy and vigor."
"Yes," he answered, "there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer, and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. I often think of those lines of old Goethe   ''Schade dass die Natur nur einen Mensch aus dir schuf, Denn zum wurdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.' By the way, apropos of this Norwood business, you see that they had, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than Lal Rao, the butler; so Jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul."
"The division seems rather unfair," I remarked. "You have done all the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what remains for you?" "For me," said Sherlock Holmes, "there still remains the cocaine bottle. " And he stretched his long white hand up for it.
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA  BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE  "A Scandal in Bohemia," which many people consider the author's best short story, describes the one instance in which Sherlock Holmes acknowledges himself "beaten by a woman's wit"; he always speaks of Irene Adler as THE woman. St. John's Wood, London, where the scene of the story is laid, is well known as the quarter of the city in which the professional artistic element of the population resides. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA  By SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE   I  To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.
It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen; but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.
Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other.
My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention; while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings; of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.
One night it was on the 20th of March, 1888 I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practise), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lighted, and even as I looked up, I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest, and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.
His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.
"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
"Seven," I answered. "Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practise again, I observe.
You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness. " "Then how do you know?" "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant-girl?"
"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but as I have changed my clothes, I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there again I fail to see how you work it out." He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the fire-light strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slicking specimen of the London slavey.
As to your practise, if a gentleman walks into my rooms, smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession." I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet, I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."
"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down Into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear.
For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."  "Frequently." "How often?"  "Well, some hundreds of times.
" "Then how many are there?" "How many?
I don't know." "Quite so!
You have not observed. And yet you have seen.
That is just my point. Now, I know there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this. " He threw over a sheet of thick pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud. " The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber, then, at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wears a mask.
" "This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?" "I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself what do you deduce from it?"
I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.
"The man who wrote it was presumably well-to-do," I remarked, endeavoring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."
"Peculiar that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all.  Hold it up to the light. " I did so, and saw a large E with a small g, a P and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper. "What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.
" "Not at all.
The G with the small t stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.'  P, of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the Eg.  Let us glance at our 'Continental Gazetteer.'"  He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ' Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills.' Ha! ha!
my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. "The paper was made in Bohemia," I said. "Precisely.
And the man who wrote the note is a German.
Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence 'This account of you we have from all quarters received'? A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts." As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.
"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties.
A hundred and fifty guineas apiece.
There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else." "I think I had better go, Holmes." "Not a bit, doctor.
Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting.
It would be a pity to miss it." "But your client "  "Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.
Sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best attention." A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. "Come in!" said Holmes.
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and front of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl.
Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheek-bones, a black visard-mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
"You had my note?" he asked, with a deep, harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. "Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Doctor Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases.
Whom have I the honor to address?"
"You may address me as the Count von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone." I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he.
"You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me." The count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight that it may have an influence upon European history. " "I promise," said Holmes.
"And I."  "You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own." "I was aware of it," said Holmes, dryly. "The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal, and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe.
To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia." "I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair, and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been, no doubt, depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. "If your majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you." The man sprang from his chair, and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried, "I am the king. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"
"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."
"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power.
I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you." "Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more. "The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
"Kindly look her up in my index, doctor," murmured Holmes, without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system for docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monogram upon the deep-sea fishes.
"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum!  Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto hum!
La Scala hum!
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw yes!
Retired from operatic stage ha! Living in London quite so! Your majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back. " "Precisely so.
But how "  "Was there a secret marriage?"
"None."
"No legal papers or certificates?"
"None."
"Then I fail to follow your majesty.
If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?" "There is the writing." "Pooh, pooh!  Forgery.
" "My private note-paper.
" "Stolen."
"My own seal.
" "Imitated." "My photograph.
" "Bought." "We were both in the photograph." "Oh, dear!
That is very bad. Your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.
" "I was mad insane." "You have compromised yourself seriously. " "I was only crown prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
"It must be recovered. " "We have tried and failed. " "Your majesty must pay. It must be bought.
" "She will not sell." "Stolen, then."
"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she traveled.
Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result." "No sign of it?"  "Absolutely none."  Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
"But a very serious one to me," returned the king, reproachfully. "Very, indeed.
And what does she propose to do with the photograph?" "To ruin me. " "But how?"  "I am about to be married." "So I have heard."
"To Clotilde Lotham von Saxe-Meiningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.
You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end." "And Irene Adler?"  "Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it.
I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men.
Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go none." "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?" "I am sure."
"And why?"
"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes, with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"  "Certainly.
You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the Count von Kramm." "Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress. " "Pray do so; I shall be all anxiety."
"Then, as to money?"  "You have carte blanche." "Absolutely?"  "I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."
"And for present expenses?"  The king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak, and laid it on the table. "There are three hundred pounds in gold, and seven hundred in notes," he said. Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book, and handed it to him.
"And mademoiselle's address?" he asked. "Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."  Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he, thoughtfully. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"
"It was." "Then, good-night, your majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you.
And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o'clock, I should like to chat this little matter over with you. " II At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned.
The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.
So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hand into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed heartily for some minutes.
"Well, really!"
he cried, and then he choked, and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair. "What is it?"  "It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.
" "I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and, perhaps, the house of Miss Irene Adler. " "Quite so, but the sequel was rather unusual.
I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsy men.
Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door.
Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window-fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. "I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.
I lent the hostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood, in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to." "And what of Irene Adler?"
I asked. "Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet.
So say the Serpentine Mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing; never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine Mews, and knew all about him.
When I had listened to all that they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign. "This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer.
That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely.
On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation." "I am following you closely," I answered.
"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door, with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home. "He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing.
Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly. 'Drive like the devil!' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!' "Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles.
It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. "'The Church of St. Monica, John," she cried; "and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes. " "This was quite too good to lose, Watson.
I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau, when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man, and hurried into the church.
There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed, and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could toward me. "'Thank God!' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!' "'What then?' I asked.
"'Come, man, come; only three minutes, or it won't be legal.' "I was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license; that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man.
The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion." "This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?" "Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced.
It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said, as she left him.
I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements." "Which are?"  "Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell.
"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your cooperation. " "I shall be delighted."
"You don't mind breaking the law?"  "Not in the least." "Nor running a chance of arrest?"  "Not in a good cause."  "Oh, the cause is excellent!"
"Then I am your man." "I was sure that I might rely on you."
"But what is it you wish?" "When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time.
It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven.
We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
"And what then?" "You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.
There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
"I am to be neutral?" "To do nothing whatever.
There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house.
Four or five minutes afterward the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window. " "Yes."  "You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you." "Yes."  "And when I raise my hand so you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire.
You quite follow me?"  "Entirely." "It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long, cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end, to make it self-lighting.
Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at the signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
"Precisely."
"Then you may entirely rely on me." "That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepared for the new rôle I have to play. " He disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman.
His broad, black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equaled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime. It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue.
It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes's succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and sever al well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.
"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess.
Now the question is where are we to find the photograph?" "Where, indeed?"  "It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size.
Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress.
She knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her." "Where, then?"  "Her banker or her lawyer.
There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither.
Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to any one else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man.
Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house. " "But it has twice been burglarized.
" "Pshaw!
They did not know how to look." "But how will you look?" "I will not look."
"What then?"  "I will get her to show me."
"But she will refuse. " "She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels.
It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter." As he spoke, the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention.
A fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.
At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top, with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked. "He is dead," cried several voices. "No, no, there's life in him," shouted another.
"But he'll be gone before you can get him to the hospital." "He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too.
Ah!
he's breathing now. " "He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"  "Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room.
There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please."
Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge, and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lighted, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man.
And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had entrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another. Holmes had sat upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air.
A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill gentlemen-hostlers, and servant-maids joined in a general shriek of "Fire!"
Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room, and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
Slipping through the shouting crowd, I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which led toward the Edgware Road. "You did it very nicely, doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right.
" "You have the photograph?" "I know where it is."
"And how did you find out?"
"She showed me, as I told you that she would." "I am still in the dark." "I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing.
"The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that every one in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening." "I guessed as much." "Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand.
I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick." "That also I could fathom." "Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in.
What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which.
They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance." "How did that help you?"
"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business.
A married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done.
The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull.
She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little overprecipitance may ruin all."
"And now?"
I asked. "Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the king to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph.
It might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands." "And when will you call?"
"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the king without delay.
" We had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:  "Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes." There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. "I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lighted street.
"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been?"    III  I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning, when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. "You have really got it?" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder, and looking eagerly into his face. "Not yet."
"But you have hopes?" "I have hopes." "Then come.
I am all impatience to be gone. " "We must have a cab." "No, my brougham is waiting." "Then that will simplify matters.
" We descended, and started off once more for Briony Lodge. "Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes. "Married! When?"
"Yesterday."
"But to whom?"  "To an English lawyer named Norton. " "But she could not love him."
"I am in hopes that she does." "And why in hopes?"  "Because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty.
If she does not love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty's plan. " "It is true. And yet Well, I wish she had been of my own station. What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue. The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps.
She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham. "Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she. "I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze. "Indeed!
My mistress told me that you were likely to call.
She left this morning, with her husband, by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross, for the Continent." "What!"  Sherlock Holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"  "Never to return."
"And the papers?" asked the king, hoarsely. "All is lost!" "We shall see."
He pushed past the servant, and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves, and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress; the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq.  To be left till called for."
My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:   "MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES; You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of the fire, I had not a suspicion.
But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think.
I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the king employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know.
Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.
Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed. "Well, I followed you to the door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband. "We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
I keep it only to safeguard myself, and preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, very truly yours,  "IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER. " "What a woman oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was?
Would she not have made an admirable queen?
Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?" "From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your majesty," said Holmes, coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your majesty's business to a more successful conclusion. " "On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the king, "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate.
The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire." "I am glad to hear your majesty say so." "I am immensely indebted to you.
Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring "  He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger, and held it out upon the palm of his hand. "Your majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.
"You have but to name it." "This photograph!"
The king stared at him in amazement. "Irene's photograph!"
he cried.
"Certainly, if you wish it." "I thank your majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honor to wish you a very good-morning.
" He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers. And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable title of the woman.
THE DOCTOR, HIS WIFE, AND THE CLOCK  BY ANNA KATHARINE GREEN  Anna Katharine Green (Rohlfs), whose name is firmly linked in the public mind with "The Leavenworth Case," is recognized as the foremost American writer of detective stories. Of these, Mrs. Rohlfs considers "The Doctor, His Wife, and the Clock" her most successful effort in the short story form. Additional interest arises from the fact that the scene is laid in those historic old buildings in Lafayette Place opposite the Astor Library, known as "the Colonnade Row," in which lived John Jacob Astor and other rich merchants two generations ago.
THE DOCTOR, HIS WIFE, AND THE CLOCK  By ANNA KATHARINE GREEN  (MRS. CHARLES ROHLFS)   I  On the 17th of July, 1851, a tragedy of no little interest occurred in one of the residences of the Colonnade in Lafayette Place. Mr. Hasbrouck, a well-known and highly respected citizen, was attacked in his room by an unknown assailant, and shot dead before assistance could reach him. His murderer escaped, and the problem offered to the police was, how to identify this person who, by some happy chance or by the exercise of the most remarkable forethought, had left no traces behind him, or any clue by which he could be followed.
The affair was given to a young man, named Ebenezer Gryce, to investigate, and the story, as he tells it, is this: When, some time after midnight, I reached Lafayette Place, I found the block lighted from end to end. Groups of excited men and women peered from the open doorways, and mingled their shadows with those of the huge pillars which adorn the front of this picturesque block of dwellings. The house in which the crime had been committed was near the centre of the row, and, long before I reached it, I had learned from more than one source that the alarm was first given to the street by a woman's shriek, and secondly by the shouts of an old man-servant who had appeared, in a half-dressed condition, at the window of Mr. Hasbrouck's room, crying, "Murder!
murder!"
But when I had crossed the threshold, I was astonished at the paucity of the facts to be gleaned from the inmates themselves.
The old servitor, who was the first to talk, had only this account of the crime to give. The family, which consisted of Mr. Hasbrouck, his wife, and three servants, had retired for the night at the usual hour and under the usual auspices. At eleven o'clock the lights were all extinguished, and the whole household asleep, with the possible exception of Mr. Hasbrouck himself, who, being a man of large business responsibilities, was frequently troubled with insomnia. Suddenly Mrs. Hasbrouck woke with a start.
Had she dreamed the words that were ringing in her ears, or had they been actually uttered in her hearing? They were short, sharp words, full of terror and menace, and she had nearly satisfied herself that she had imagined them, when there came, from somewhere near the door, a sound she neither understood nor could interpret, but which filled her with inexplicable terror, and made her afraid to breathe, or even to stretch forth her hand toward her husband, whom she supposed to be sleeping at her side. At length another strange sound, which she was sure was not due to her imagination, drove her to make an attempt to rouse him, when she was horrified to find that she was alone in the bed, and her husband nowhere within reach. Filled now with something more than nervous apprehension, she flung herself to the floor, and tried to penetrate, with frenzied glances, the surrounding darkness.
But the blinds and shutters both having been carefully closed by Mr. Hasbrouck before retiring, she found this impossible, and she was about to sink in terror to the floor, when she heard a low gasp on the other side of the room, followed by the suppressed cry:  "God!
what have I done!"
The voice was a strange one, but before the fear aroused by this fact could culminate in a shriek of dismay, she caught the sound of retreating footsteps, and, eagerly listening, she heard them descend the stairs and depart by the front door.
Had she known what had occurred had there been no doubt in her mind as to what lay in the darkness on the other side of the room it is likely that, at the noise caused by the closing front door, she would have made at once for the balcony that opened out from the window before which she was standing, and taken one look at the flying figure below. But her uncertainty as to what lay hidden from her by the darkness chained her feet to the floor, and there is no knowing when she would have moved, if a carriage had not at that moment passed down Astor Place, bringing with it a sense of companionship which broke the spell that held her, and gave her strength to light the gas, which was in ready reach of her hand.
As the sudden blaze illuminated the room, revealing in a burst the old familiar walls and well-known pieces of furniture, she felt for a moment as if released from some heavy nightmare and restored to the common experiences of life. But in another instant her former dread returned, and she found herself quaking at the prospect of passing around the foot of the bed into that part of the room which was as yet hidden from her eyes.
But the desperation which comes with great crises finally drove her from her retreat; and, creeping slowly forward, she cast one glance at the floor before her, when she found her worst fears realized by the sight of the dead body of her husband lying prone before the open doorway, with a bullet-hole in his forehead.
Her first impulse was to shriek, but, by a powerful exercise of will, she checked herself, and, ringing frantically for the servants who slept on the top floor of the house, flew to the nearest window and endeavored to open it. But the shutters had been bolted so securely by Mr. Hasbrouck, in his endeavor to shut out light and sound, that by the time she had succeeded in unfastening them, all trace of the flying murderer had vanished from the street.
Sick with grief and terror, she stepped back into the room just as the three frightened servants descended the stairs. As they appeared in the open doorway, she pointed at her husband's inanimate form, and then, as if suddenly realizing in its full force the calamity which had befallen her, she threw up her arms, and sank forward to the floor in a dead faint. The two women rushed to her assistance, but the old butler, bounding over the bed, sprang to the window, and shrieked his alarm to the street. In the interim that followed, Mrs. Hasbrouck was revived, and the master's body laid decently on the bed; but no pursuit was made, nor any inquiries started likely to assist me in establishing the identity of the assailant. Indeed, every one, both in the house and out, seemed dazed by the unexpected catastrophe, and as no one had any suspicions to offer as to the probable murderer, I had a difficult task before me.
I began, in the usual way, by inspecting the scene of the murder. I found nothing in the room, or in the condition of the body itself, which added an iota to the knowledge already obtained. That Mr. Hasbrouck had been in bed; that he had risen upon hearing a noise; and that he had been shot before reaching the door, were self-evident facts. But there was nothing to guide me further.
The very simplicity of the circumstances caused a dearth of clues, which made the difficulty of procedure as great as any I ever encountered. My search through the hall and down the stairs elicited nothing; and an investigation of the bolts and bars by which the house was secured, assured me that the assassin had either entered by the front door, or had already been secreted in the house when it was locked up for the night. "I shall have to trouble Mrs. Hasbrouck for a short interview," I hereupon announced to the trembling old servitor, who had followed me like a dog about the house. He made no demur, and in a few minutes I was ushered into the presence of the newly made widow, who sat quite alone, in a large chamber in the rear. As I crossed the threshold she looked up, and I encountered a good plain face, without the shadow of guile in it.
"Madam," said I, "I have not come to disturb you. I will ask two or three questions only, and then leave you to your grief. I am told that some words came from the assassin before he delivered his fatal shot. Did you hear these distinctly enough to tell me what they were?"
"I was sound asleep," said she, "and dreamt, as I thought, that a fierce, strange voice cried somewhere to some one: 'Ah!
you did not expect me!' But I dare not say that these words were really uttered to my husband, for he was not the man to call forth hate, and only a man in the extremity of passion could address such an exclamation in such a tone as rings in my memory in connection with the fatal shot which woke me."
"But that shot was not the work of a friend," I argued.
"If, as these words seem to prove, the assassin had some other motive than gain in his assault, then your husband had an enemy, though you never suspected it." "Impossible!" was her steady reply, uttered in the most convincing tone. "The man who shot him was a common burglar, and, frightened at having been betrayed into murder, fled without looking for booty.
I am sure I heard him cry out in terror and remorse: 'God!
what have I done!'"  "Was that before you left the side of the bed?" "Yes; I did not move from my place till I heard the front door close. I was paralyzed by my fear and dread. " "Are you in the habit of trusting to the security of a latch-lock only in the fastening of your front door at night?
I am told that the big key was not in the lock, and that the bolt at the bottom of the door was not drawn." "The bolt at the bottom of the door is never drawn. Mr. Hasbrouck was so good a man he never mistrusted any one. That is why the big lock was not fastened. The key, not working well, he took it some days ago to the locksmith, and when the latter failed to return it, he laughed, and said he thought no one would ever think of meddling with his front door."  "Is there more than one night-key to your house?"
I now asked. She shook her head. "And when did Mr. Hasbrouck last use his?"  "To-night, when he came home from prayer-meeting," she answered, and burst into tears. Her grief was so real and her loss so recent that I hesitated to afflict her by further questions. So returning to the scene of the tragedy, I stepped out upon the balcony which ran in front.
Soft voices instantly struck my ears. The neighbors on either side were grouped in front of their own windows, and were exchanging the remarks natural under the circumstances. I paused, as in duty bound, and listened. But I heard nothing worth recording, and would have instantly reentered the house, if I had not been impressed by the appearance of a very graceful woman who stood at my right.
She was clinging to her husband, who was gazing at one of the pillars before him in a strange, fixed way which astonished me till he attempted to move, and then I saw that he was blind. Instantly I remembered that there lived in this row a blind doctor, equally celebrated for his skill and for his uncommon personal attractions, and, greatly interested not only in his affliction, but in the sympathy evinced for him by his young and affectionate wife, I stood still till I heard her say in the soft and appealing tones of love:  "Come in, Constant; you have heavy duties for to-morrow, and you should get a few hours' rest, if possible." He came from the shadow of the pillar, and for one minute I saw his face with the lamplight shining full upon it. It was as regular of feature as a sculptured Adonis, and it was as white.
"Sleep!"
he repeated, in the measured tones of deep but suppressed feeling. "Sleep!
with murder on the other side of the wall!"
And he stretched out his arms in a dazed way that insensibly accentuated the horror I myself felt of the crime which had so lately taken place in the room behind me. She, noting the movement, took one of the groping hands in her own and drew him gently toward her. "This way," she urged; and, guiding him into the house, she closed the window and drew down the shades, making the street seem darker by the loss of her exquisite presence.
This may seem a digression, but I was at the time a young man of thirty, and much under the dominion of woman's beauty. I was therefore slow in leaving the balcony, and persistent in my wish to learn something of this remarkable couple before leaving Mr. Hasbrouck's house. The story told me was very simple. Dr. Zabriskie had not been born blind, but had become so after a grievous illness which had stricken him down soon after he received his diploma. Instead of succumbing to an affliction which would have daunted most men, he expressed his intention of practising his profession, and soon became so successful in it that he found no difficulty in establishing himself in one of the best paying quarters of the city.
Indeed, his intuition seemed to have developed in a remarkable degree after his loss of sight, and he seldom, if ever, made a mistake in diagnosis. Considering this fact, and the personal attractions which gave him distinction, it was no wonder that he soon became a popular physician whose presence was a benefaction and whose word a law. He had been engaged to be married at the time of his illness, and, when he learned what was likely to be its results, had offered to release the young lady from all obligation to him. But she would not be released, and they were married.
This had taken place some five years previous to Mr. Hasbrouck's death, three of which had been spent by them in Lafayette Place. So much for the beautiful woman next door.
There being absolutely no clue to the assailant of Mr. Hasbrouck, I naturally looked forward to the inquest for some evidence upon which to work. But there seemed to be no underlying facts to this tragedy.
The most careful study into the habits and conduct of the deceased brought nothing to light save his general beneficence and rectitude, nor was there in his history or in that of his wife any secret or hidden obligation calculated to provoke any such act of revenge as murder. Mrs. Hasbrouck's surmise that the intruder was simply a burglar, and that she had rather imagined than heard the words that pointed to the shooting as a deed of vengeance, soon gained general credence. But, though the police worked long and arduously in this new direction, their efforts were without fruit, and the case bade fair to remain an unsolvable mystery.
But the deeper the mystery the more persistently does my mind cling to it, and some five months after the matter had been delegated to oblivion, I found myself starting suddenly from sleep, with these words ringing in my ears:  "Who uttered the scream that gave the first alarm of Mr. Hasbrouck's violent death?"
I was in such a state of excitement that the perspiration stood out on my forehead.
Mrs. Hasbrouck's story of the occurrence returned to me, and I remembered as distinctly as if she were then speaking, that she had expressly stated that she did not scream when confronted by the sight of her husband's dead body. But some one had screamed, and that very loudly.
Who was it, then? One of the maids, startled by the sudden summons from below, or some one else some involuntary witness of the crime, whose testimony had been suppressed at the inquest, by fear or influence? The possibility of having come upon a clue even at this late day, so fired my ambition, that I took the first opportunity of revisiting Lafayette Place.
Choosing such persons as I thought most open to my questions, I learned that there were many who could testify to having heard a woman's shrill scream on that memorable night just prior to the alarm given by old Cyrus, but no one who could tell from whose lips it had come. One fact, however, was immediately settled. It had not been the result of the servant-women's fears.
Both of the girls were positive that they had uttered no sound, nor had they themselves heard any, till Cyrus rushed to the window with his wild cries. As the scream, by whomever given, was uttered before they descended the stairs, I was convinced by these assurances that it had issued from one of the front windows, and not from the rear of the house, where their own rooms lay. Could it be that it had sprung from the adjoining dwelling, and that   My thoughts went no further, but I made up my mind to visit the Doctor's house at once.
It took some courage to do this, for the Doctor's wife had attended the inquest, and her beauty, seen in broad daylight, had worn such an aspect of mingled sweetness and dignity, that I hesitated to encounter it under any circumstances likely to disturb its pure serenity. But a clue, once grasped, can not be lightly set aside by a true detective, and it would have taken more than a woman's frown to stop me at this point.
So I rang Dr. Zabriskie's bell. I am seventy years old now and am no longer daunted by the charms of a beautiful woman, but I confess that when I found myself in the fine reception parlor on the first floor, I experienced no little trepidation at the prospect of the interview which awaited me. But as soon as the fine commanding form of the Doctor's wife crossed the threshold, I recovered my senses and surveyed her with as direct a gaze as my position allowed.
For her aspect bespoke a degree of emotion that astonished me; and even before I spoke I perceived her to be trembling, though she was a woman of no little natural dignity and self-possession. "I seem to know your face," she said, advancing courteously toward me, "but your name" and here she glanced at the card she held in her hand "is totally unfamiliar to me." "I think you saw me some eighteen months ago," said I. "I am the detective who gave testimony at the inquest which was held over the remains of Mr. Hasbrouck. " I had not meant to startle her, but at this introduction of myself I saw her naturally pale cheek turn paler, and her fine eyes, which had been fixed curiously upon me, gradually sink to the floor. "Great heaven!" thought I, "what is this I have stumbled upon!"
"I do not understand what business you can have with me," she presently remarked, with a show of gentle indifference that did not in the least deceive me. "I do not wonder," I rejoined. "The crime which took place next door is almost forgotten by the community, and even if it were not, I am sure you would find it difficult to conjecture the nature of the question I have to put to you."
"I am surprised," she began, rising in her involuntary emotion and thereby compelling me to rise also. "How can you have any question to ask me on this subject? Yet if you have," she continued, with a rapid change of manner that touched my heart in spite of myself, "I shall, of course, do my best to answer you."
There are women whose sweetest tones and most charming smiles only serve to awaken distrust in men of my calling; but Mrs. Zabriskie was not of this number. Her face was beautiful, but it was also candid in its expression, and beneath the agitation which palpably disturbed her, I was sure there lurked nothing either wicked or false. Yet I held fast by the clue which I had grasped, as it were, in the dark, and without knowing whither I was tending, much less whither I was leading her, I proceeded to say:  "The question which I presume to put to you as the next-door neighbor of Mr. Hasbrouck, is this: Who was the woman who screamed out so loudly that the whole neighborhood heard her on the night of that gentleman's assassination?" The gasp she gave answered my question in a way she little realized, and, struck as I was by the impalpable links that had led me to the threshold of this hitherto unsolvable mystery, I was about to press my advantage and ask another question, when she quickly started forward and laid her hand on my lips. Astonished, I looked at her inquiringly, but her head was turned aside, and her eyes, fixed upon the door, showed the greatest anxiety. Instantly I realized what she feared. Her husband was entering the house, and she dreaded lest his ears should catch a word of our conversation.
Not knowing what was in her mind, and unable to realize the importance of the moment to her, I yet listened to the advance of her blind husband with an almost painful interest. Would he enter the room where we were, or would he pass immediately to his office in the rear? She seemed to wonder too, and almost held her breath as he neared the door, paused, and stood in the open doorway, with his ear turned toward us. As for myself, I remained perfectly still, gazing at his face in mingled surprise and apprehension. For besides its beauty, which was of a marked order, as I have already observed, it had a touching expression which irresistibly aroused both pity and interest in the spectator.
This may have been the result of his affliction, or it may have sprung from some deeper cause; but, whatever its source, this look in his face produced a strong impression upon me and interested me at once in his personality. Would he enter? Or would he pass on?
Her look of silent appeal showed me in which direction her wishes lay, but while I answered her glance by complete silence, I was conscious in some indistinct way that the business I had undertaken would be better furthered by his entrance. The blind have been often said to possess a sixth sense in place of the one they have lost. Though I am sure we made no noise, I soon perceived that he was aware of our presence.
Stepping hastily forward, he said, in the high and vibrating tone of restrained passion:  "Helen, are you here?" For a moment I thought she did not mean to answer, but knowing doubtless from experience the impossibility of deceiving him, she answered with a cheerful assent, dropping her hand as she did so from before my lips. He heard the slight rustle which accompanied the movement, and a look I found it hard to comprehend flashed over his features, altering his expression so completely that he seemed another man.
"You have some one with you," he declared, advancing another step but with none of the uncertainty which usually accompanies the movements of the blind. "Some dear friend," he went on, with an almost sarcastic emphasis and a forced smile that had little of gaiety in it. The agitated and distressed blush which answered him could have but one interpretation.
He suspected that her hand had been clasped in mine, and she perceived his thought and knew that I perceived it also. Drawing herself up, she moved toward him, saying in a sweet, womanly tone that to me spoke volumes:  "It is no friend, Constant, not even an acquaintance. The person whom I now present to you is an agent from the police.
He is here upon a trivial errand which will be soon finished, when I will join you in your office." I knew she was but taking a choice between two evils. That she would have saved her husband the knowledge of a detective's presence in the house, if her self-respect would have allowed it, but neither she nor I anticipated the effect which this presentation produced upon him. "A police officer," he repeated, staring with his sightless eyes, as if, in his eagerness to see, he half hoped his lost sense would return.
"He can have no trivial errand here; he has been sent by God Himself to "  "Let me speak for you," hastily interposed his wife, springing to his side and clasping his arm with a fervor that was equally expressive of appeal and command. Then turning to me, she explained: "Since Mr. Hasbrouck's unaccountable death, my husband has been laboring under a hallucination which I have only to mention for you to recognize its perfect absurdity. He thinks oh!
do not look like that, Constant; you know it is a hallucination which must vanish the moment we drag it into broad daylight that he he, the best man in all the world, was himself the assailant of Mr. Hasbrouck." Good God!
"I say nothing of the impossibility of this being so," she went on in a fever of expostulation. "He is blind, and could not have delivered such a shot even if he had desired to; besides, he had no weapon.
But the inconsistency of the thing speaks for itself, and should assure him that his mind is unbalanced and that he is merely suffering from a shock that was greater than we realized.
He is a physician and has had many such instances in his own practise. Why, he was very much attached to Mr. Hasbrouck! They were the best of friends, and though he insists that he killed him, he can not give any reason for the deed."
At these words the Doctor's face grew stern, and he spoke like an automaton repeating some fearful lesson. "I killed him. I went to his room and deliberately shot him. I had nothing against him, and my remorse is extreme.
Arrest me, and let me pay the penalty of my crime. It is the only way in which I can obtain peace."
Shocked beyond all power of self-control by this repetition of what she evidently considered the unhappy ravings of a madman, she let go his arm and turned upon me in frenzy. "Convince him!"
she cried. "Convince him by your questions that he never could have done this fearful thing. " I was laboring under great excitement myself, for I felt my youth against me in a matter of such tragic consequence. Besides, I agreed with her that he was in a distempered state of mind, and I hardly knew how to deal with one so fixed in his hallucination and with so much intelligence to support it.
But the emergency was great, for he was holding out his wrists in the evident expectation of my taking him into instant custody; and the sight was killing his wife, who had sunk on the floor between us, in terror and anguish.
"You say you killed Mr. Hasbrouck," I began. "Where did you get your pistol, and what did you do with it after you left his house?" "My husband had no pistol; never had any pistol," put in Mrs. Zabriskie, with vehement assertion.
"If I had seen him with such a weapon "  "I threw it away. When I left the house, I cast it as far from me as possible, for I was frightened at what I had done, horribly frightened." "No pistol was ever found," I answered, with a smile, forgetting for the moment that he could not see.
"If such an instrument had been found in the street after a murder of such consequence it certainly would have been brought to the police. " "You forget that a good pistol is valuable property," he went on stolidly. "Some one came along before the general alarm was given; and seeing such a treasure lying on the sidewalk, picked it up and carried it off. Not being an honest man, he preferred to keep it to drawing the attention of the police upon himself." "Hum, perhaps," said I; "but where did you get it.
Surely you can tell where you procured such a weapon, if, as your wife intimates, you did not own one."
"I bought it that self-same night of a friend; a friend whom I will not name, since he resides no longer in this country. I "  He paused; intense passion was in his face; he turned toward his wife, and a low cry escaped him, which made her look up in fear. "I do not wish to go into any particulars," said he.
"God forsook me and I committed a horrible crime. When I am punished, perhaps peace will return to me and happiness to her. I would not wish her to suffer too long or too bitterly for my sin." "Constant!"
What love was in the cry! and what despair!
It seemed to move him and turn his thoughts for a moment into a different channel. "Poor child!"
he murmured, stretching out his hands by an irresistible impulse toward her. But the change was but momentary, and he was soon again the stern and determined self-accuser.
"Are you going to take me before a magistrate?" he asked. "If so, I have a few duties to perform which you are welcome to witness." "I have no warrant," I said; "besides, I am scarcely the one to take such a responsibility upon myself.
If, however, you persist in your declaration, I will communicate with my superiors, who will take such action as they think best."
"That will be still more satisfactory to me," said he; "for though I have many times contemplated giving myself up to the authorities, I have still much to do before I can leave my home and practise without injury to others. Good-day; when you want me, you will find me here." He was gone, and the poor young wife was left crouching on the floor alone. Pitying her shame and terror, I ventured to remark that it was not an uncommon thing for a man to confess to a crime he had never committed, and assured her that the matter would be inquired into very carefully before any attempt was made upon his liberty.
She thanked me, and, slowly rising, tried to regain her equanimity; but the manner as well as the matter of her husband's self-condemnation was too overwhelming in its nature for her to recover readily from her emotions. "I have long dreaded this," she acknowledged. "For months I have foreseen that he would make some rash communication or insane avowal.
If I had dared, I would have consulted some physician about this hallucination of his; but he was so sane on other points that I hesitated to give my dreadful secret to the world. I kept hoping that time and his daily pursuits would have their effect and restore him to himself. But his illusion grows, and now I fear that nothing will ever convince him that he did not commit the deed of which he accuses himself.
If he were not blind I would have more hope, but the blind have so much time for brooding." "I think he had better be indulged in his fancies for the present," I ventured. "If he is laboring under an illusion it might be dangerous to cross him." "If?" she echoed in an indescribable tone of amazement and dread.
"Can you for a moment harbor the idea that he has spoken the truth?" "Madam," I returned, with something of the cynicism of my later years, "what caused you to give such an unearthly scream just before this murder was made known to the neighborhood?"
She stared, paled, and finally began to tremble, not, as I now believe, at the insinuation latent in my words, but at the doubts which my question aroused in her own breast. "Did I?" she asked; then with a great burst of candor, which seemed inseparable from her nature, she continued: "Why do I try to mislead you or deceive myself? I did give a shriek just before the alarm was raised next door; but it was not from any knowledge I had of a crime having been committed, but because I unexpectedly saw before me my husband whom I supposed to be on his way to Poughkeepsie.
He was looking very pale and strange, and for a moment I thought I was beholding his ghost. But he soon explained his appearance by saying that he had fallen from the train and had been only saved by a miracle from being dismembered; and I was just bemoaning his mishap and trying to calm him and myself, when that terrible shout was heard next door of 'Murder!
murder!'  Coming so soon after the shock he had himself experienced, it quite unnerved him, and I think we can date his mental disturbance from that moment.
For he began almost immediately to take a morbid interest in the affair next door, though it was weeks, if not months, before he let a word fall of the nature of those you have just heard. Indeed it was not till I repeated to him some of the expressions he was continually letting fall in his sleep, that he commenced to accuse himself of crime and talk of retribution." "You say that your husband frightened you on that night by appearing suddenly at the door when you thought him on his way to Poughkeepsie.
Is Dr. Zabriskie in the habit of thus going and coming alone at an hour so late as this must have been?"
"You forget that to the blind, night is less full of perils than the day.
Often and often has my husband found his way to his patients' houses alone after midnight; but on this especial evening he had Harry with him. Harry was his driver, and always accompanied him when he went any distance. " "Well, then," said I, "all we have to do is to summon Harry and hear what he has to say concerning this affair. He surely will know whether or not his master went into the house next door.
" "Harry has left us," she said. "Dr. Zabriskie has another driver now. Besides (I have nothing to conceal from you) Harry was not with him when he returned to the house that evening, or the Doctor would not have been without his portmanteau till the next day. Something I have never known what caused them to separate, and that is why I have no answer to give the Doctor when he accuses himself of committing a deed on that night which is wholly out of keeping with every other act of his life."
"And have you never questioned Harry why they separated and why he allowed his master to come home alone after the shock he had received at the station?"
"I did not know there was any reason for doing so till long after he left us."
"And when did he leave?" "That I do not remember. A few weeks, or possibly a few days, after that dreadful night.
" "And where is he now?" "Ah, that I have not the least means of knowing. But," she suddenly cried, "what do you want of Harry?
If he did not follow Dr. Zabriskie to his own door, he could tell us nothing that would convince my husband that he is laboring under an illusion."
"But he might tell us something which would convince us that Dr. Zabriskie was not himself after the accident that he "  "Hush!" came from her lips in imperious tones.
"I will not believe that he shot Mr. Hasbrouck even if you prove him to have been insane at the time. How could he? My husband is blind. It would take a man of very keen sight to force himself into a house that was closed for the night, and kill a man in the dark at one shot. " "Rather," cried a voice from the doorway, "it is only a blind man who could do this.
Those who trust to eyesight must be able to catch some glimpse of the mark they aim at, and this room, as I have been told, was without a glimmer of light. But the blind trust to sound, and as Mr. Hasbrouck spoke "  "Oh!" burst from the horrified wife, "is there no one to stop him when he speaks like that?"    II  When I related to my superiors the details of the foregoing interview, two of them coincided with the wife in thinking that Dr. Zabriskie was in an irresponsible condition of mind which made any statement of his questionable.
But the third seemed disposed to argue the matter, and, casting me an inquiring look, seemed to ask what my opinion was on the subject.
Answering him as if he had spoken, I gave my conclusion as follows: That whether insane or not, Dr. Zabriskie had fired the shot which terminated Mr. Hasbrouck's life. It was the Inspector's own idea, but it was not shared in by the others, one of whom had known the Doctor for years. Accordingly they compromised by postponing all opinion till they had themselves interrogated the Doctor, and I was detailed to bring him before them the next afternoon. He came without reluctance, his wife accompanying him.
In the short time which elapsed between their leaving Lafayette Place and entering Headquarters, I embraced the opportunity of observing them, and I found the study equally exciting and interesting. His face was calm but hopeless, and his eye, which should have shown a wild glimmer if there was truth in his wife's hypothesis, was dark and unfathomable, but neither frenzied nor uncertain. He spake but once and listened to nothing, though now and then his wife moved as if to attract his attention, and once even stole her hand toward his, in the tender hope that he would feel its approach and accept her sympathy. But he was deaf as well as blind; and sat wrapped up in thoughts which she, I know, would have given worlds to penetrate.
Her countenance was not without its mystery also. She showed in every lineament passionate concern and misery, and a deep tenderness from which the element of fear was not absent. But she, as well as he, betrayed that some misunderstanding, deeper than any I had previously suspected, drew its intangible veil between them and made the near proximity in which they sat, at once a heart-piercing delight and an unspeakable pain.
What was this misunderstanding? and what was the character of the fear that modified her every look of love in his direction? Her perfect indifference to my presence proved that it was not connected with the position in which he had put himself toward the police by his voluntary confession of crime, nor could I thus interpret the expression of frantic question which now and then contracted her features, as she raised her eyes toward his sightless orbs, and strove to read, in his firm-set lips, the meaning of those assertions she could only ascribe to a loss of reason. The stopping of the carriage seemed to awaken both from thoughts that separated rather than united them. He turned his face in her direction, and she, stretching forth her hand, prepared to lead him from the carriage, without any of that display of timidity which had been previously evident in her manner.
As his guide she seemed to fear nothing; as his lover, everything. "There is another and a deeper tragedy underlying the outward and obvious one," was my inward conclusion, as I followed them into the presence of the gentlemen awaiting them. Dr. Zabriskie's appearance was a shock to those who knew him; so was his manner, which was calm, straightforward, and quietly determined. "I shot Mr. Hasbrouck," was his steady affirmation, given without any show of frenzy or desperation. "If you ask me why I did it, I can not answer; if you ask me how, I am ready to state all that I know concerning the matter."
"But, Dr. Zabriskie," interposed his friend, "the why is the most important thing for us to consider just now. If you really desire to convince us that you committed the dreadful crime of killing a totally inoffensive man, you should give us some reason for an act so opposed to all your instincts and general conduct. " But the Doctor continued unmoved:  "I had no reason for murdering Mr. Hasbrouck.
A hundred questions can elicit no other reply; you had better keep to the how." A deep-drawn breath from the wife answered the looks of the three gentlemen to whom this suggestion was offered.
"You see," that breath seemed to protest, "that he is not in his right mind." I began to waver in my own opinion, and yet the intuition which has served me in cases as seemingly impenetrable as this bade me beware of following the general judgment. "Ask him to inform you how he got into the house," I whispered to Inspector D, who sat nearest me. Immediately the Inspector put the question I had suggested:  "By what means did you enter Mr. Hasbrouck's house at so late an hour as this murder occurred?"
The blind doctor's head fell forward on his breast, and he hesitated for the first and only time. "You will not believe me," said he; "but the door was ajar when I came to it. Such things make crime easy; it is the only excuse I have to offer for this dreadful deed.
" The front door of a respectable citizen's house ajar at half-past eleven at night. It was a statement that fixed in all minds the conviction of the speaker's irresponsibility. Mrs. Zabriskie's brow cleared, and her beauty became for a moment dazzling as she held out her hands in irrepressible relief toward those who were interrogating her husband. I alone kept my impassibility. A possible explanation of this crime had flashed like lightning across my mind; an explanation from which I inwardly recoiled, even while I was forced to consider it.
"Dr. Zabriskie," remarked the Inspector who was most friendly to him, "such old servants as those kept by Mr. Hasbrouck do not leave the front door ajar at twelve o'clock at night." "Yet ajar it was," repeated the blind doctor, with quiet emphasis; "and finding it so, I went in. When I came out again, I closed it. Do you wish me to swear to what I say? If so, I am ready."
What could we reply? To see this splendid-looking man, hallowed by an affliction so great that in itself it called forth the compassion of the most indifferent, accusing himself of a cold-blooded crime, in tones that sounded dispassionate because of the will that forced their utterance, was too painful in itself for us to indulge in any unnecessary words. Compassion took the place of curiosity, and each and all of us turned involuntary looks of pity upon the young wife pressing so eagerly to his side.
"For a blind man," ventured one, "the assault was both deft and certain. Are you accustomed to Mr. Hasbrouck's house, that you found your way with so little difficulty to his bedroom?" "I am accustomed " he began. But here his wife broke in with irrepressible passion:  "He is not accustomed to that house.
He has never been beyond the first floor. Why, why do you question him? Do you not see "  His hand was on her lips. "Hush!" he commanded. "You know my skill in moving about a house; how I sometimes deceive those who do not know me into believing that I can see, by the readiness with which I avoid obstacles and find my way even in strange and untried scenes.
Do not try to make them think I am not in my right mind, or you will drive me into the very condition you deprecate." His face, rigid, cold, and set, looked like that of a mask. Hers, drawn with horror and filled with question that was fast taking the form of doubt, bespoke an awful tragedy from which more than one of us recoiled.
"Can you shoot a man dead without seeing him?" asked the Superintendent, with painful effort. "Give me a pistol and I will show you," was the quick reply. A low cry came from the wife.
In a drawer near to every one of us there lay a pistol, but no one moved to take it out. There was a look in the Doctor's eye which made us fear to trust him with a pistol just then. "We will accept your assurance that you possess a skill beyond that of most men," returned the Superintendent. And beckoning me forward, he whispered: "This is a case for the doctors and not for the police.
Remove him quietly, and notify Dr. Southyard of what I say." But Dr. Zabriskie, who seemed to have an almost supernatural acuteness of hearing, gave a violent start at this and spoke up for the first time with real passion in his voice:  "No, no, I pray you.
I can bear anything but that. Remember, gentlemen, that I am blind; that I can not see who is about me; that my life would be a torture if I felt myself surrounded by spies watching to catch some evidence of madness in me. Rather conviction at once, death, dishonor, and obloquy.
These I have incurred. These I have brought upon myself by crime, but not this worse fate oh! not this worse fate." His passion was so intense and yet so confined within the bounds of decorum that we felt strangely impressed by it.
Only the wife stood transfixed, with the dread growing in her heart, till her white, waxen visage seemed even more terrible to contemplate than his passion-distorted one. "It is not strange that my wife thinks me demented," the Doctor continued, as if afraid of the silence that answered him. "But it is your business to discriminate, and you should know a sane man when you see him."
Inspector D no longer hesitated. "Very well," said he, "give us the least proof that your assertions are true, and we will lay your case before the prosecuting attorney. " "Proof?  Is not a man's word "  "No man's confession is worth much without some evidence to support it. In your case there is none.
You can not even produce the pistol with which you assert yourself to have committed the deed." "True, true.
I was frightened by what I had done, and the instinct of self-preservation led me to rid myself of the weapon in any way I could. But some one found this pistol; some one picked it up from the sidewalk of Lafayette Place on that fatal night.
Advertise for it.
Offer a reward. I will give you the money." Suddenly he appeared to realize how all this sounded.
"Alas!" cried he, "I know the story seems improbable; all I say seems improbable; but it is not the probable things that happen in this life, but the improbable, as you should know, who every day dig deep into the heart of human affairs." Were these the ravings of insanity? I began to understand the wife's terror.
"I bought the pistol," he went on, "of alas! I can not tell you his name. Everything is against me.
I can not adduce one proof; yet she, even she, is beginning to fear that my story is true. I know it by her silence, a silence that yawns between us like a deep and unfathomable gulf." But at these words her voice rang out with passionate vehemence.
"No, no, it is false! I will never believe that your hands have been plunged in blood. You are my own pure-hearted Constant, cold, perhaps, and stern, but with no guilt upon your conscience, save in your own wild imagination. " "Helen, you are no friend to me," he declared, pushing her gently aside.
"Believe me innocent, but say nothing to lead these others to doubt my word." And she said no more, but her looks spoke volumes. The result was that he was not detained, though he prayed for instant commitment.
He seemed to dread his own home, and the surveillance to which he instinctively knew he would henceforth be subjected. To see him shrink from his wife's hand as she strove to lead him from the room was sufficiently painful; but the feeling thus aroused was nothing to that with which we observed the keen and agonized expectancy of his look as he turned and listened for the steps of the officer who followed him. "I shall never again know whether or not I am alone," was his final observation as he left our presence. I said nothing to my superiors of the thoughts I had had while listening to the above interrogatories.
A theory had presented itself to my mind which explained in some measure the mysteries of the Doctor's conduct, but I wished for time and opportunity to test its reasonableness before submitting it to their higher judgment. And these seemed likely to be given me, for the Inspectors continued divided in their opinion of the blind physician's guilt, and the District-Attorney, when told of the affair, pooh-poohed it without mercy, and declined to stir in the matter unless some tangible evidence were forthcoming to substantiate the poor Doctor's self-accusations. "If guilty, why does he shrink from giving his motives," said he, "and if so anxious to go to the gallows, why does he suppress the very facts calculated to send him there? He is as mad as a March hare, and it is to an asylum he should go and not to a jail." In this conclusion I failed to agree with him, and as time wore on my suspicions took shape and finally ended in a fixed conviction.
Dr. Zabriskie had committed the crime he avowed, but let me proceed a little further with my story before I reveal what lies beyond that "but." Notwithstanding Dr. Zabriskie's almost frenzied appeal for solitude, a man had been placed in surveillance over him in the shape of a young doctor skilled in diseases of the brain. This man communicated more or less with the police, and one morning I received from him the following extracts from the diary he had been ordered to keep:   "The Doctor is settling into a deep melancholy from which he tries to rise at times, but with only indifferent success.
Yesterday he rode around to all his patients for the purpose of withdrawing his services on the plea of illness. But he still keeps his office open, and to-day I had the opportunity of witnessing his reception and treatment of the many sufferers who came to him for aid.
I think he was conscious of my presence, though an attempt had been made to conceal it. For the listening look never left his face from the moment he entered the room, and once he rose and passed quickly from wall to wall, groping with outstretched hands into every nook and corner, and barely escaping contact with the curtain behind which I was hidden. But if he suspected my presence, he showed no displeasure at it, wishing perhaps for a witness to his skill in the treatment of disease.
"And truly I never beheld a finer manifestation of practical insight in cases of a more or less baffling nature than I beheld in him to-day. He is certainly a most wonderful physician, and I feel bound to record that his mind is as clear for business as if no shadow had fallen upon it. "Dr. Zabriskie loves his wife, but in a way that tortures both himself and her. If she is gone from the house he is wretched, and yet when she returns he often forbears to speak to her, or if he does speak, it is with a constraint that hurts her more than his silence.
I was present when she came in to-day. Her step, which had been eager on the stairway, flagged as she approached the room, and he naturally noted the change and gave his own interpretation to it. His face, which had been very pale, flushed suddenly, and a nervous trembling seized him which he sought in vain to hide. But by the time her tall and beautiful figure stood in the doorway he was his usual self again in all but the expression of his eyes, which stared straight before him in an agony of longing only to be observed in those who have once seen.
"'Where have you been, Helen?' he asked, as, contrary to his wont, he moved to meet her. "'To my mother's, to Arnold & Constable's, and to the hospital, as you requested,' was her quick answer, made without faltering or embarrassment. "He stepped still nearer and took her hand, and as he did so my physician's eye noted how his finger lay over her pulse in seeming unconsciousness. "'Nowhere else?' he queried.
"She smiled the saddest kind of smile and shook her head; then, remembering that he could not see this movement, she cried in a wistful tone:  "'Nowhere else, Constant; I was too anxious to get back.' "I expected him to drop her hand at this, but he did not; and his finger still rested on her pulse. "'And whom did you see while you were gone?' he continued.
"She told him, naming over several names. "'You must have enjoyed yourself,' was his cold comment, as he let go her hand and turned away. But his manner showed relief, and I could not but sympathize with the pitiable situation of a man who found himself forced to means like these for probing the heart of his young wife.
"Yet when I turned toward her I realized that her position was but little happier than his. Tears are no strangers to her eyes, but those that welled up at this moment seemed to possess a bitterness that promised but little peace for her future. Yet she quickly dried them and busied herself with ministrations for his comfort.
"If I am any judge of woman, Helen Zabriskie is superior to most of her sex. That her husband mistrusts her is evident, but whether this is the result of the stand she has taken in his regard, or only a manifestation of dementia, I have as yet been unable to determine. I dread to leave them alone together, and yet when I presume to suggest that she should be on her guard in her interviews with him, she smiles very placidly and tells me that nothing would give her greater joy than to see him lift his hand against her, for that would argue that he is not accountable for his deeds or for his assertions.
"Yet it would be a grief to see her injured by this passionate and unhappy man. "You have said that you wanted all details I could give; so I feel bound to say that Dr. Zabriskie tries to be considerate of his wife, though he often fails in the attempt. When she offers herself as his guide, or assists him with his mail, or performs any of the many acts of kindness by which she continually manifests her sense of his affliction, he thanks her with courtesy and often with kindness, yet I know she would willingly exchange all his set phrases for one fond embrace or impulsive smile of affection. That he is not in the full possession of his faculties would be too much to say, and yet upon what other hypothesis can we account for the inconsistencies of his conduct?
"I have before me two visions of mental suffering. At noon I passed the office door, and looking within, saw the figure of Dr. Zabriskie seated in his great chair, lost in thought or deep in those memories which make an abyss in one's consciousness. His hands, which were clenched, rested upon the arms of his chair, and in one of them I detected a woman's glove, which I had no difficulty in recognizing as one of the pair worn by his wife this morning.
He held it as a tiger might hold his prey or a miser his gold, but his set features and sightless eyes betrayed that a conflict of emotions was waging within him, among which tenderness had but little share. "Though alive, as he usually is, to every sound, he was too absorbed at this moment to notice my presence, though I had taken no pains to approach quietly. I therefore stood for a full minute watching him, till an irresistible sense of the shame of thus spying upon a blind man in his moments of secret anguish seized upon me and I turned away. But not before I saw his features relax in a storm of passionate feeling, as he rained kisses after kisses on the senseless kid he had so long held in his motionless grasp.
Yet when an hour later he entered the dining-room on his wife's arm, there was nothing in his manner to show that he had in any way changed in his attitude toward her.
"The other picture was more tragic still. I have no business with Mrs. Zabriskie's affairs; but as I passed upstairs to my room an hour ago, I caught a fleeting vision of her tall form, with the arms thrown up over her head in a paroxysm of feeling which made her as oblivious to my presence as her husband had been several hours before. Were the words that escaped her lips, 'Thank God we have no children!' or was this exclamation suggested to me by the passion and unrestrained impulse of her action?"
Side by side with these lines, I, Ebenezer Gryce, placed the following extracts from my own diary:   "Watched the Zabriskie mansion for five hours this morning, from the second story window of an adjoining hotel.
Saw the Doctor when he drove away on his round of visits, and saw him when he returned. A colored man accompanied him. "To-day I followed Mrs. Zabriskie. I had a motive for this, the nature of which I think it wisest not to divulge.
She went first to a house in Washington Place where I am told her mother lives. Here she stayed some time, after which she drove down to Canal Street, where she did some shopping, and later stopped at the hospital, into which I took the liberty of following her. She seemed to know many there, and passed from cot to cot with a smile in which I alone discerned the sadness of a broken heart. When she left, I left also, without having learned anything beyond the fact that Mrs. Zabriskie is one who does her duty in sorrow as in happiness.
A rare and trustworthy woman I should say, and yet her husband does not trust her. Why?    "I have spent this day in accumulating details in regard to Dr. and Mrs. Zabriskie's life previous to the death of Mr. Hasbrouck. I learned from sources it would be unwise to quote just here that Mrs. Zabriskie had not lacked enemies ready to charge her with coquetry; that while she had never sacrificed her dignity in public, more than one person had been heard to declare that Dr. Zabriskie was fortunate in being blind, since the sight of his wife's beauty would have but poorly compensated him for the pain he would have suffered in seeing how that beauty was admired. "That all gossip is more or less tinged with exaggeration I have no doubt, yet when a name is mentioned in connection with such stories, there is usually some truth at the bottom of them.
And a name is mentioned in this case, though I do not think it worth my while to repeat it here; and loth as I am to recognize the fact, it is a name that carries with it doubts that might easily account for the husband's jealousy. True, I have found no one who dares to hint that she still continues to attract attention or to bestow smiles in any direction save where they legally belong. For since a certain memorable night which we all know, neither Dr. Zabriskie nor his wife have been seen save in their own domestic circle, and it is not into such scenes that this serpent, of which I have spoken, ever intrudes, nor is it in places of sorrow or suffering that his smile shines, or his fascinations flourish.
"And so one portion of my theory is proved to be sound. Dr. Zabriskie is jealous of his wife: whether with good cause or bad I am not prepared to decide; for her present attitude, clouded as it is by the tragedy in which she and her husband are both involved, must differ very much from that which she held when her life was unshadowed by doubt, and her admirers could be counted by the score. "I have just found out where Harry is.
As he is in service some miles up the river, I shall have to be absent from my post for several hours, but I consider the game well worth the candle.
"Light at last.
I have seen Harry, and, by means known only to the police, have succeeded in making him talk. His story is substantially this: That on the night so often mentioned, he packed his master's portmanteau at eight o'clock and at ten called a carriage and rode with the Doctor to the Twenty-ninth Street station. He was told to buy tickets for Poughkeepsie, where his master had been called in consultation, and having done this, hurried back to join his master on the platform.
They had walked together as far as the cars, and Dr. Zabriskie was just stepping on to the train when a man pushed himself hurriedly between them and whispered something into his master's ear, which caused him to fall back and lose his footing. Dr. Zabriskie's body slid half under the car, but he was withdrawn before any harm was done, though the cars gave a lurch at that moment which must have frightened him exceedingly, for his face was white when he rose to his feet, and when Harry offered to assist him again on to the train, he refused to go and said he would return home and not attempt to ride to Poughkeepsie that night. "The gentleman, whom Harry now saw to be Mr. Stanton, an intimate friend of Dr. Zabriskie, smiled very queerly at this, and taking the Doctor's arm led him away to a carriage.
Harry naturally followed them, but the Doctor, hearing his steps, turned and bade him, in a very peremptory tone, to take the omnibus home, and then, as if on second thought, told him to go to Poughkeepsie in his stead and explain to the people there that he was too shaken up by his misstep to do his duty, and that he would be with them next morning. This seemed strange to Harry, but he had no reasons for disobeying his master's orders, and so rode to Poughkeepsie. But the Doctor did not follow him the next day; on the contrary, he telegraphed for him to return, and when he got back dismissed him with a month's wages.
This ended Harry's connection with the Zabriskie family. "A simple story bearing out what the wife has already told us; but it furnishes a link which may prove invaluable. Mr. Stanton, whose first name is Theodore, knows the real reason why Dr. Zabriskie returned home on the night of the seventeenth of July, 1851. Mr. Stanton, consequently, I must see, and this shall be my business to-morrow. "Checkmate!  Theodore Stanton is not in this country.
Though this points him out as the man from whom Dr. Zabriskie bought the pistol, it does not facilitate my work, which is becoming more and more difficult.
"Mr. Stanton's whereabouts are not even known to his most intimate friends. He sailed from this country most unexpectedly on the eighteenth of July a year ago, which was the day after the murder of Mr. Hasbrouck. It looks like a flight, especially as he has failed to maintain open communication even with his relatives. Was he the man who shot Mr. Hasbrouck?
No; but he was the man who put the pistol in Dr. Zabriskie's hand that night, and, whether he did this with purpose or not, was evidently so alarmed at the catastrophe which followed that he took the first outgoing steamer to Europe. So far, all is clear, but there are mysteries yet to be solved, which will require my utmost tact. What if I should seek out the gentleman with whose name that of Mrs. Zabriskie has been linked, and see If I can in any way connect him with Mr. Stanton or the events of that night? "Eureka!
I have discovered that Mr. Stanton cherished a mortal hatred for the gentleman above mentioned. It was a covert feeling, but no less deadly on that account; and while it never led him into any extravagances, it was of force sufficient to account for many a secret misfortune which happened to that gentleman. Now, if I can prove he was the Mephistopheles who whispered insinuations into the ear of our blind Faust, I may strike a fact that will lead me out of this maze. "But how can I approach secrets so delicate without compromising the woman I feel bound to respect, if only for the devoted love she manifests for her unhappy husband!
"I shall have to appeal to Joe Smithers. This is something which I always hate to do, but as long as he will take money, and as long as he is fertile in resources for obtaining the truth from people I am myself unable to reach, so long must I make use of his cupidity and his genius. He is an honorable fellow in one way, and never retails as gossip what he acquires for our use. How will he proceed in this case, and by what tactics will be gain the very delicate information which we need? I own that I am curious to see.
"I shall really have to put down at length the incidents of this night. I always knew that Joe Smithers was invaluable to the police, but I really did not know he possessed talents of so high an order. He wrote me this morning that he had succeeded in getting Mr. T's promise to spend the evening with him, and advised me that if I desired to be present also, his own servant would not be at home, and that an opener of bottles would be required. "As I was very anxious to see Mr. T with my own eyes, I accepted the invitation to play the spy upon a spy, and went at the proper hour to Mr. Smithers's rooms, which are in the University Building.
I found them picturesque in the extreme. Piles of books stacked here and there to the ceiling made nooks and corners which could be quite shut off by a couple of old pictures that were set into movable frames that swung out or in at the whim or convenience of the owner. "As I liked the dark shadows cast by these pictures, I pulled them both out, and made such other arrangements as appeared likely to facilitate the purpose I had in view; then I sat down and waited for the two gentlemen who were expected to come in together. "They arrived almost immediately, whereupon I rose and played my part with all necessary discretion.
While ridding Mr. T of his overcoat, I stole a look at his face. It is not a handsome one, but it boasts of a gay, devil-may-care expression which doubtless makes it dangerous to many women, while his manners are especially attractive, and his voice the richest and most persuasive that I ever heard. I contrasted him, almost against my will, with Dr. Zabriskie, and decided that with most women the former's undoubted fascinations of speech and bearing would outweigh the latter's great beauty and mental endowments; but I doubted if they would with her.
"The conversation which immediately began was brilliant but desultory, for Mr. Smithers, with an airy lightness for which he is remarkable, introduced topic after topic, perhaps for the purpose of showing off Mr. T's versatility, and perhaps for the deeper and more sinister purpose of shaking the kaleidoscope of talk so thoroughly, that the real topic which we were met to discuss should not make an undue impression on the mind of his guest. "Meanwhile one, two, three bottles passed, and I saw Joe Smithers's eye grow calmer and that of Mr. T more brilliant and more uncertain. As the last bottle showed signs of failing, Joe cast me a meaning glance, and the real business of the evening began. "I shall not attempt to relate the half-dozen failures which Joe made in endeavoring to elicit the facts we were in search of, without arousing the suspicion of his visitor.
I am only going to relate the successful attempt. They had been talking now for some hours, and I, who had long before been waved from their immediate presence, was hiding my curiosity and growing excitement behind one of the pictures, when suddenly I heard Joe say:  "'He has the most remarkable memory I ever met. He can tell to a day when any notable event occurred.'  "Pshaw!' answered his companion, who, by the by, was known to pride himself upon his own memory for dates, 'I can state where I went and what I did on every day in the year. That may not embrace what you call "notable events," but the memory required is all the more remarkable, is it not?' "'Pooh!' was his friend's provoking reply, 'you are bluffing, Ben; I will never believe that.' "Mr. T, who had passed by this time into that state of intoxication which makes persistence in an assertion a duty as well as a pleasure, threw back his head, and as the wreaths of smoke rose in airy spirals from his lips, reiterated his statement, and offered to submit to any test of his vaunted powers which the other might dictate. "'You have a diary ' began Joe. "'Which is at home,' completed the other. "'Will you allow me to refer to it to-morrow, if I am suspicious of the accuracy of your recollections?'  "'Undoubtedly,' returned the other.
"'Very well, then, I will wager you a cool fifty that you can not tell where you were between the hours of ten and eleven on a certain night which I will name.' "'Done!' cried the other, bringing out his pocket-book and laying it on the table before him. "Joe followed his example and then summoned me. "'Write a date down here,' he commanded, pushing a piece of paper toward me, with a look keen as the flash of a blade.
'Any date, man,' he added, as I appeared to hesitate in the embarrassment I thought natural under the circumstances.  'Put down day, month, and year, only don't go too far back; not farther than two years.' "Smiling with the air of a flunkey admitted to the sports of his superiors, I wrote a line and laid it before Mr. Smithers, who at once pushed it with a careless gesture toward his companion. You can of course guess the date I made use of: July 17, 1851. Mr. T, who had evidently looked upon this matter as mere play, flushed scarlet as he read these words, and for one instant looked as if he had rather flee our presence than answer Joe Smithers's nonchalant glance of inquiry.
"'I have given my word and will keep it,' he said at last, but with a look in my direction that sent me reluctantly back to my retreat. 'I don't suppose you want names,' he went on, 'that is, if anything I have to tell is of a delicate nature?'  "'O no,' answered the other, 'only facts and places.' "'I don't think places are necessary either,' he returned.
'I will tell you what I did and that must serve you. I did not promise to give number and street.' "'Well, well,' Joe exclaimed; 'earn your fifty, that is all. Show that you remember where you were on the night of' and with an admirable show of indifference he pretended to consult the paper between them 'the seventeenth of July, 1851, and I shall be satisfied.' "'I was at the club for one thing,' said Mr. T; 'then I went to see a lady friend, where I stayed till eleven. She wore a blue muslin What is that?' "I had betrayed myself by a quick movement which sent a glass tumbler crashing to the floor. Helen Zabriskie had worn a blue muslin on that same night. I had noted it when I stood on the balcony watching her and her husband.
"'That noise?'  It was Joe who was speaking. 'You don't know Reuben as well as I do or you wouldn't ask. It is his practise, I am sorry to say, to accentuate his pleasure in draining my bottles, by dropping a glass at every third one.' "Mr. T went on. "'She was a married woman and I thought she loved me; but and this is the greatest proof I can offer you that I am giving you a true account of that night she had not had the slightest idea of the extent of my passion, and only consented to see me at all because she thought, poor thing, that a word from her would set me straight, and rid her of attentions that were fast becoming obnoxious.
A sorry figure for a fellow to cut who has not been without his triumphs; but you caught me on the most detestable date in my calendar, and '  "There is where he stopped being interesting, so I will not waste time by quoting further. And now what reply shall I make when Joe Smithers asks me double his usual price, as he will be sure to do, next time?
Has he not earned an advance? I really think so. "I have spent the whole day in weaving together the facts I have gleaned, and the suspicions I have formed, into a consecutive whole likely to present my theory in a favorable light to my superiors. But just as I thought myself in shape to meet their inquiries, I received an immediate summons into their presence, where I was given a duty to perform of so extraordinary and unexpected a nature, that it effectually drove from my mind all my own plans for the elucidation of the Zabriskie mystery.
"This was nothing more or less than to take charge of a party of people who were going to the Jersey Heights for the purpose of testing Dr. Zabriskie's skill with a pistol." III  The cause of this sudden move was soon explained to me. Mrs. Zabriskie, anxious to have an end put to the present condition of affairs, had begged for a more rigid examination into her husband's state.
This being accorded, a strict and impartial inquiry had taken place, with a result not unlike that which followed the first one. Three out of his four interrogators judged him insane, and could not be moved from their opinion though opposed by the verdict of the young expert who had been living in the house with him. Dr. Zabriskie seemed to read their thoughts, and, showing extreme agitation, begged as before for an opportunity to prove his sanity by showing his skill in shooting.
This time a disposition was evinced to grant his request, which Mrs. Zabriskie no sooner perceived, than she added her supplications to his that the question might be thus settled. A pistol was accordingly brought; but at sight of it her courage failed, and she changed her prayer to an entreaty that the experiment should be postponed till the next day, and should then take place in the woods away from the sight and hearing of needless spectators. Though it would have been much wiser to have ended the matter there and then, the Superintendent was prevailed upon to listen to her entreaties, and thus it was that I came to be a spectator, if not a participator, in the final scene of this most sombre drama.
There are some events which impress the human mind so deeply that their memory mingles with all after-experiences. Though I have made it a rule to forget as soon as possible the tragic episodes into which I am constantly plunged, there is one scene in my life which will not depart at my will; and that is the sight which met my eyes from the bow of the small boat in which Dr. Zabriskie and his wife were rowed over to Jersey on that memorable afternoon.
Though it was by no means late in the day, the sun was already sinking, and the bright red glare which filled the heavens and shone full upon the faces of the half-dozen persons before me added much to the tragic nature of the scene, though we were far from comprehending its full significance.
The Doctor sat with his wife in the stern, and it was upon their faces my glance was fixed. The glare shone luridly on his sightless eyeballs, and as I noticed his unwinking lids I realized as never before what it was to be blind in the midst of sunshine. Her eyes, on the contrary, were lowered, but there was a look of hopeless misery in her colorless face which made her appearance infinitely pathetic, and I felt confident that if he could only have seen her, he would not have maintained the cold and unresponsive manner which chilled the words on her lips and made all advance on her part impossible. On the seat in front of them sat the Inspector and a doctor, and from some quarter, possibly from under the Inspector's coat, there came the monotonous ticking of a small clock, which, I had been told, was to serve as a target for the blind man's aim.
This tickling was all I heard, though the noise and bustle of a great traffic was pressing upon us on every side. And I am sure it was all that she heard, as, with hand pressed to her heart and eyes fixed on the opposite shore, she waited for the event which was to determine whether the man she loved was a criminal or only a being afflicted of God, and worthy of her unceasing care and devotion. As the sun cast its last scarlet gleam over the water, the boat grounded, and it fell to my lot to assist Mrs. Zabriskie up the bank. As I did so, I allowed myself to say: "I am your friend, Mrs. Zabriskie," and was astonished to see her tremble, and turn toward me with a look like that of a frightened child.
But there was always this characteristic blending in her countenance of the childlike and the severe, such as may so often be seen in the faces of nuns, and beyond an added pang of pity for this beautiful but afflicted woman, I let the moment pass without giving it the weight it perhaps demanded.
"The Doctor and his wife had a long talk last night," was whispered in my ear as we wound our way along into the woods. I turned and perceived at my side the expert physician, portions of whose diary I have already quoted. He had come by another boat. "But it did not seem to heal whatever breach lies between them," he proceeded.
Then in a quick, curious tone, he asked: "Do you believe this attempt on his part is likely to prove anything but a farce?" "I believe he will shatter the clock to pieces with his first shot," I answered, and could say no more, for we had already reached the ground which had been selected for this trial at arms, and the various members of the party were being placed in their several positions. The Doctor, to whom light and darkness were alike, stood with his face toward the western glow, and at his side were grouped the Inspector and the two physicians.
On the arm of one of the latter hung Dr. Zabriskie's overcoat, which he had taken off as soon as he reached the field. Mrs. Zabriskie stood at the other end of the opening, near a tall stump, upon which it had been decided that the clock should be placed when the moment came for the Doctor to show his skill. She had been accorded the privilege of setting the clock on this stump, and I saw it shining in her hand as she paused for a moment to glance back at the circle of gentlemen who were awaiting her movements. The hands of the clock stood at five minutes to five, though I scarcely noted the fact at the time, for her eyes were on mine, and as she passed me she spoke:  "If he is not himself, he can not be trusted. Watch him carefully, and see that he does no mischief to himself or others.
Be at his right hand, and stop him if he does not handle his pistol properly. " I promised, and she passed on, setting the clock upon the stump and immediately drawing back to a suitable distance at the right, where she stood, wrapped in her long dark cloak, quite alone. Her face shone ghastly white, even in its environment of snow-covered boughs which surrounded her, and, noting this, I wished the minutes fewer between the present moment and the hour of five, at which he was to draw the trigger.
"Dr. Zabriskie," quoth the Inspector, "we have endeavored to make this trial a perfectly fair one. You are to have one shot at a small clock which has been placed within a suitable distance, and which you are expected to hit, guided only by the sound which it will make in striking the hour of five. Are you satisfied with the arrangement?"  "Perfectly.
Where is my wife?"
"On the other side of the field, some ten paces from the stump upon which the clock is fixed." He bowed, and his face showed satisfaction. "May I expect the clock to strike soon?"
"In less than five minutes," was the answer. "Then let me have the pistol; I wish to become acquainted with its size and weight." We glanced at each other, then across at her.
She made a gesture; it was one of acquiescence. Immediately the Inspector placed the weapon in the blind man's hand. It was at once apparent that the Doctor understood the instrument, and my last doubt vanished as to the truth of all he had told us. "Thank God I am blind this hour and can not see her," fell unconsciously from his lips; then, before the echo of these words had left my ears, he raised his voice and observed calmly enough, considering that he was about to prove himself a criminal in order to save himself from being thought a madman:  "Let no one move. I must have my ears free for catching the first stroke of the clock.
" And he raised the pistol before him. There was a moment of torturing suspense and deep, unbroken silence. My eyes were on him, and so I did not watch the clock, but suddenly I was moved by some irresistible impulse to note how Mrs. Zabriskie was bearing herself at this critical moment, and, casting a hurried glance in her direction, I perceived her tall figure swaying from side to side, as if under an intolerable strain of feeling. Her eyes were on the clock, the hands of which seemed to creep with snail-like pace along the dial, when unexpectedly, and a full minute before the minute hand had reached the stroke of five, I caught a movement on her part, saw the flash of something round and white show for an instant against the darkness of her cloak, and was about to shriek warning to the Doctor, when the shrill, quick stroke of a clock rang out on the frosty air, followed by the ping and flash of a pistol. A sound of shattered glass, followed by a suppressed cry, told us that the bullet had struck the mark, but before we could move, or rid our eyes of the smoke which the wind had blown into our faces, there came another sound which made our hair stand on end and sent the blood back in terror to our hearts.
Another clock was striking, the clock which we now perceived was still standing upright on the stump where Mrs. Zabriskie had placed it. Whence came the clock, then, which had struck before the time and been shattered for its pains? One quick look told us. On the ground, ten paces at the right, lay Helen Zabriskie, a broken clock at her side, and in her breast a bullet which was fast sapping the life from her sweet eyes. We had to tell him, there was such pleading in her looks; and never shall I forget the scream that rang from his lips as he realized the truth.
Breaking from our midst, he rushed forward, and fell at her feet as if guided by some supernatural instinct. "Helen," he shrieked, "what is this? Were not my hands dyed deep enough in blood that you should make me answerable for your life also? " Her eyes were closed, but she opened them.
Looking long and steadily at his agonized face, she faltered forth:  "It is not you who have killed me; it is your crime. Had you been innocent of Mr. Hasbrouck's death, your bullet would never have found my heart. Did you think I could survive the proof that you had killed that good man?" "I I did it unwittingly.
I "  "Hush!" she commanded, with an awful look, which, happily, he could not see. "I had another motive. I wished to prove to you, even at the cost of my life, that I loved you, had always loved you, and not "  It was now his turn to silence her. His hand crept over her lips, and his despairing face turned itself blindly toward us.
"Go," he cried; "leave us! Let me take a last farewell of my dying wife, without listeners or spectators." Consulting the eye of the physician who stood beside me, and seeing no hope in it, I fell slowly back.
The others followed, and the Doctor was left alone with his wife. From the distant position we took, we saw her arms creep round his neck, saw her head fall confidingly on his breast, then silence settled upon them and upon all nature, the gathering twilight deepening, till the last glow disappeared from the heavens above and from the circle of leafless trees which enclosed this tragedy from the outside world. But at last there came a stir, and Dr. Zabriskie, rising up before us, with the dead body of his wife held closely to his breast, confronted us with a countenance so rapturous that he looked like a man transfigured.
"I will carry her to the boat," said he. "Not another hand shall touch her. She was my true wife, my true wife!" And he towered into an attitude of such dignity and passion that for a moment he took on heroic proportions and we forgot that he had just proved himself to have committed a cold-blooded and ghastly crime. The stars were shining when we again took our seats in the boat; and if the scene of our crossing to Jersey was impressive, what shall be said of that of our return?
The Doctor, as before, sat in the stern, an awesome figure, upon which the moon shone with a white radiance that seemed to lift his face out of the surrounding darkness and set it, like an image of frozen horror, before our eyes. Against his breast he held the form of his dead wife, and now and then I saw him stoop as if he were listening for some tokens of life at her set lips. Then he would lift himself again, with hopelessness stamped upon his features, only to lean forward in renewed hope that was again destined to disappointment. The Inspector and the accompanying physician had taken seats in the bow, and unto me had been assigned the special duty of watching over the Doctor. This I did from a low seat in front of him.
I was therefore so close that I heard his laboring breath, and though my heart was full of awe and compassion, I could not prevent myself from bending toward him and saying these words:  "Dr. Zabriskie, the mystery of your crime is no longer a mystery to me. Listen and see if I do not understand your temptation, and how you, a conscientious and God-fearing man, came to slay your innocent neighbor. "A friend of yours, or so he called himself, had for a long time filled your ears with tales tending to make you suspicious of your wife and jealous of a certain man whom I will not name. You knew that your friend had a grudge against this man, and so for many months turned a deaf ear to his insinuations. But finally some change which you detected in your wife's bearing or conversation roused your own suspicions, and you began to doubt if all was false that came to your ears, and to curse your blindness, which in a measure rendered you helpless.
The jealous fever grew and had risen to a high point, when one night a memorable night this friend met you just as you were leaving town, and with cruel craft whispered in your ear that the man you hated was even then with your wife, and that if you would return at once to your home you would find him in her company. "The demon that lurks at the heart of all men, good or bad, thereupon took complete possession of you, and you answered this fake friend by saying that you would not return without a pistol. Whereupon he offered to take you to his house and give you his. You consented, and getting rid of your servant by sending him to Poughkeepsie with your excuses, you entered a coach with your friend.
"You say you bought the pistol, and perhaps you did, but, however that may be, you left his house with it in your pocket and, declining companionship, walked home, arriving at the Colonnade a little before midnight. "Ordinarily you have no difficulty in recognizing your own doorstep. But, being in a heated frame of mind, you walked faster than usual and so passed your own house and stopped at that of Mr. Hasbrouck's, one door beyond.
As the entrances of these houses are all alike, there was but one way by which you could have made yourself sure that you had reached your own dwelling, and that was by feeling for the doctor's sign at the side of the door. But you never thought of that.
Absorbed in dreams of vengeance, your sole impulse was to enter by the quickest means possible. Taking out your night-key, you thrust it into the lock. It fitted, but it took strength to turn it, so much strength that the key was twisted and bent by the effort. But this incident, which would have attracted your attention at another time, was lost upon you at this moment.
An entrance had been effected, and you were in too excited a frame of mind to notice at what cost, or to detect the small differences apparent in the atmosphere and furnishings of the two houses trifles which would have arrested your attention under other circumstances, and made you pause before the upper floor had been reached. "It was while going up the stairs that you took out your pistol, so that by the time you arrived at the front-room door you held it ready cocked and drawn in your hand. For, being blind, you feared escape on the part of your victim, and so waited for nothing but the sound of a man's voice before firing. When, therefore, the unfortunate Mr. Hasbrouck, roused by this sudden intrusion, advanced with an exclamation of astonishment, you pulled the trigger, killing him on the spot.
It must have been immediately upon his fall that you recognized from some word he uttered, or from some contact you may have had with your surroundings, that you were in the wrong house and had killed the wrong man; for you cried out, in evident remorse, 'God! what have I done!' and fled without approaching your victim. "Descending the stairs, you rushed from the house, closing the front door behind you and regaining your own without being seen.
But here you found yourself baffled in your attempted escape by two things.
First, by the pistol you still held in your hand, and secondly, by the fact that the key upon which you depended for entering your own door was so twisted out of shape that you knew it would be useless for you to attempt to use it. What did you do in this emergency? You have already told us, though the story seemed so improbable at the time, you found nobody to believe it but myself.
The pistol you flung far away from you down the pavement, from which, by one of those rare chances which sometimes happen in this world, it was presently picked up by some late passer-by of more or less doubtful character. The door offered less of an obstacle than you anticipated; for when you turned to it again you found it, if I am not greatly mistaken, ajar, left so, as we have reason to believe, by one who had gone out of it but a few minutes before in a state which left him but little master of his actions. It was this fact which provided you with an answer when you were asked how you succeeded in getting into Mr. Hasbrouck's house after the family had retired for the night. "Astonished at the coincidence, but hailing with gladness the deliverance which it offered, you went in and ascended at once into your wife's presence; and it was from her lips, and not from those of Mrs. Hasbrouck, that the cry arose which startled the neighborhood and prepared men's minds for the tragic words which were shouted a moment later from the next house. "But she who uttered the scream knew of no tragedy save that which was taking place in her own breast.
She had just repulsed a dastardly suitor, and, seeing you enter so unexpectedly in a state of unaccountable horror and agitation, was naturally stricken with dismay, and thought she saw your ghost, or, what was worse, a possible avenger; while you, having failed to kill the man you sought, and having killed a man you esteemed, let no surprise on her part lure you into any dangerous self-betrayal. You strove instead to soothe her, and even attempted to explain the excitement under which you labored, by an account of your narrow escape at the station, till the sudden alarm from next door distracted her attention, and sent both your thoughts and hers in a different direction. Not till conscience had fully awakened and the horror of your act had had time to tell upon your sensitive nature, did you breathe forth those vague confessions, which, not being supported by the only explanations which would have made them credible, led her, as well as the police, to consider you affected in your mind. Your pride as a man, and your consideration for her as a woman, kept you silent, but did not keep the worm from preying upon your heart.
"Am I not correct in my surmises, Dr. Zabriskie, and is not this the true explanation of your crime?"
With a strange look, he lifted up his face. "Hush!" said he; "you will awaken her. See how peacefully she sleeps! I should not like to have her awakened now, she is so tired, and I I have not watched over her as I should." Appalled at his gesture, his look, his tone, I drew back, and for a few minutes no sound was to be heard but the steady dip-dip of the oars and the lap-lap of the waters against the boat.
Then there came a quick uprising, the swaying before me of something dark and tall and threatening, and before I could speak or move, or even stretch forth my hands to stay him, the seat before me was empty, and darkness had filled the place where but an instant previous he had sat, a fearsome figure, erect and rigid as a sphinx. What little moonlight there was only served to show us a few rising bubbles, marking the spot where the unfortunate man had sunk with his much-loved burden. We could not save him. As the widening circles fled farther and farther out, the tide drifted us away, and we lost the spot which had seen the termination of one of earth's saddest tragedies.
The bodies were never recovered. The police reserved to themselves the right of withholding from the public the real facts which made this catastrophe an awful remembrance to those who witnessed it. A verdict of accidental death by drowning answered all purposes, and saved the memory of the unfortunate pair from such calumny as might have otherwise assailed it.
It was the least we could do for two beings whom circumstances had so greatly afflicted. THE RAJAH'S DIAMOND  BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON The four stories published under this general title are four steps in the unraveling of the mystery of "The Pride of Kashgar," that marvelous diamond "as big as a duck's egg and without a flaw, whose value, in money, would be sufficient to build cathedrals more stately than Ely or Cologne. " Through them moves that prince of entertainers, Prince Florizel of Bohemia.
The buoyant, extravagant note of the author is one of the most refreshing things in short-story literature, and the stories have that rare quality of charm which was the peculiar grace of the author's personality. THE RAJAH'S DIAMOND  By ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON    STORY OF THE BANDBOX  Up to the age of sixteen, at a private school and afterward at one of those great institutions for which England is justly famous, Mr. Harry Hartley had received the ordinary education of a gentleman. At that period, he manifested a remarkable distaste for study; and his only surviving parent being both weak and ignorant, he was permitted thenceforward to spend his time in the attainment of petty and purely elegant accomplishments. Two years later, he was left an orphan and almost a beggar.
For all active and industrious pursuits, Harry was unfitted alike by nature and training. He could sing romantic ditties, and accompany himself with discretion on the piano; he was a graceful although a timid cavalier; he had a pronounced taste for chess; and nature had sent him into the world with one of the most engaging exteriors that can well be fancied. Blond and pink, with dove's eyes and a gentle smile, he had an air of agreeable tenderness and melancholy, and the most submissive and caressing manners. But when all is said, he was not the man to lead armaments of war, or direct the councils of a state.
A fortunate chance and some influence obtained for Harry, at the time of his bereavement, the position of private secretary to Major-General Sir Thomas Vandeleur, C.B.  Sir Thomas was a man of sixty, loud-spoken, boisterous, and domineering. For some reason, some service the nature of which had been often whispered and repeatedly denied, the Rajah of Kashgar had presented this officer with the sixth known diamond of the world. The gift transformed General Vandeleur from a poor into a wealthy man, from an obscure and unpopular soldier into one of the lions of London society; the possessor of the Rajah's Diamond was welcome in the most exclusive circles; and he had found a lady, young, beautiful, and well-born, who was willing to call the diamond hers even at the price of marriage with Sir Thomas Vandeleur. It was commonly said at the time that, as like draws to like, one jewel had attracted another; certainly Lady Vandeleur was not only a gem of the finest water in her own person, but she showed herself to the world in a very costly setting; and she was considered by many respectable authorities as one among the three or four best dressed women in England. Harry's duty as secretary was not particularly onerous; but he had a dislike for all prolonged work; it gave him pain to ink his fingers; and the charm of Lady Vandeleur and her toilets drew him often from the library to the boudoir.
He had the prettiest ways among women, could talk fashions with enjoyment, and was never more happy than when criticizing a shade of ribbon, or running on an errand to the milliner's. In short, Sir Thomas's correspondence fell into pitiful arrears, and my Lady had another lady's-maid. At last the General, who was one of the least patient of military commanders, arose from his place in a violent access of passion, and indicated to his secretary that he had no further need for his services, with one of those explanatory gestures which are most rarely employed between gentlemen. The door being unfortunately open, Mr. Hartley fell downstairs headforemost.
He arose somewhat hurt and very deeply aggrieved. The life in the General's house precisely suited him; he moved, on a more or less doubtful footing, in very genteel company, he did little, he ate of the best, and he had a lukewarm satisfaction in the presence of Lady Vandeleur, which, in his own heart, he dubbed by a more emphatic name. Immediately after he had been outraged by the military foot, he hurried to the boudoir and recounted his sorrows.
"You know very well, my dear Harry," replied Lady Vandeleur, for she called him by name like a child or a domestic servant, "that you never by any chance do what the General tells you. No more do I, you may say. But that is different.
A woman can earn her pardon for a good year of disobedience by a single adroit submission; and, besides, no one is married to his private secretary. I shall be sorry to lose you; but since you can not stay longer in a house where you have been insulted, I shall wish you good-by, and I promise you to make the General smart for his behavior." Harry's countenance fell; tears came into his eyes and he gazed on Lady Vandeleur with a tender reproach.
"My Lady," said he, "what is an insult? I should think little indeed of any one who could not forgive them by the score. But to leave one's friend; to tear up the bonds of affection "  He was unable to continue, for his emotion choked him, and he began to weep.
Lady Vandeleur looked at him with a curious expression. "This little fool," she thought, "imagines himself to be in love with me. Why should he not become my servant instead of the General's?
He is good-natured, obliging, and understands dress; and besides it will keep him out of mischief. He is positively too pretty to be unattached. " That night she talked over the General, who was already somewhat ashamed of his vivacity; and Harry was transferred to the feminine department, where his life was little short of heavenly.
He was always dressed with uncommon nicety, wore delicate flowers in his buttonhole, and could entertain a visitor with tact and pleasantry. He took a pride in servility to a beautiful woman; received Lady Vandeleur's commands as so many marks of favor; and was pleased to exhibit himself before other men, who derided and despised him, in his character of male lady's-maid and man milliner. Nor could he think enough of his existence from a moral point of view. Wickedness seemed to him an essentially male attribute, and to pass one's days with a delicate woman, and principally occupied about trimmings, was to inhabit an enchanted isle among the storms of life. One fine morning he came into the drawing-room and began to arrange some music on the top of the piano.
Lady Vandeleur, at the other end of the apartment, was speaking somewhat eagerly with her brother, Charlie Pendragon, an elderly young man, much broken with dissipation, and very lame of one foot. The private secretary, to whose entrance they paid no regard, could not avoid overhearing a part of their conversation. "To-day or never," said the lady. "Once and for all, it shall be done to-day. " "To-day if it must be," replied the brother, with a sigh.
"But it is a false step, a ruinous step, Clara; and we shall live to repent it dismally." Lady Vandeleur looked her brother steadily and somewhat strangely in the face. "You forget," she said; "the man must die at last. " "Upon my word, Clara," said Pendragon, "I believe you are the most heartless rascal in England."
"You men," she returned, "are so coarsely built, that you can never appreciate a shade of meaning. You are yourselves rapacious, violent, immodest, careless of distinction; and yet the least thought for the future shocks you in a woman. I have no patience with such stuff.
You would despise in a common banker the imbecility that you expect to find in us. " "You are very likely right," replied her brother; "you were always cleverer than I. And, anyway, you know my motto: 'The family before all.'"  "Yes, Charlie," she returned, taking his hand in hers, "I know your motto better than you know it yourself. ' And Clara before the family!'  Is not that the second part of it? Indeed, you are the best of brothers, and I love you dearly." Mr. Pendragon got up, looking a little confused by these family endearments. "I had better not be seen," said he.
"I understand my part to a miracle, and I'll keep an eye on the Tame Cat."  "Do," she replied. "He is an abject creature, and might ruin all. " She kissed the tips of her fingers to him daintily; and the brother withdrew by the boudoir and the back stair.
"Harry," said Lady Vandeleur, turning toward the secretary as soon as they were alone, "I have a commission for you this morning. But you shall take a cab; I can not have my secretary freckled.
" She spoke the last words with emphasis and a look of half-motherly pride that caused great contentment to poor Harry; and he professed himself charmed to find an opportunity of serving her. "It is another of our great secrets," she went on, archly, "and no one must know of it but my secretary and me. Sir Thomas would make the saddest disturbance; and if you only knew how weary I am of these scenes! Oh, Harry, Harry, can you explain to me what makes you men so violent and unjust?
But, indeed, I know you can not; you are the only man in the world who knows nothing of these shameful passions; you are so good, Harry, and so kind; you, at least, can be a woman's friend; and, do you know?
I think you make the others more ugly by comparison." "It is you," said Harry, gallantly, "who are so kind to me. You treat me like "  "Like a mother," interposed Lady Vandeleur, "I try to be a mother to you.
Or, at least," she corrected herself with a smile, "almost a mother. I am afraid I am too young to be your mother really. Let us say a friend a dear friend."
She paused long enough to let her words take effect in Harry's sentimental quarters, but not long enough to allow him a reply. "But all this is beside our purpose," she resumed. "You will find a bandbox in the left-hand side of the oak wardrobe; it is underneath the pink slip that I wore on Wednesday with my Mechlin. You will take it immediately to this address," and she gave him a paper; "but do not, on any account, let it out of your hands until you have received a receipt written by myself.
Do you understand? Answer, if you please answer! This is extremely important, and I must ask you to pay some attention." Harry pacified her by repeating her instructions perfectly; and she was just going to tell him more when General Vandeleur flung into the apartment, scarlet with anger, and holding a long and elaborate milliner's bill in his hand. "Will you look at this, madam!" cried he.
"Will you have the goodness to look at this document? I know well enough you married me for my money, and I hope I can make as great allowances as any other man in the service; but, as sure as God made me, I mean to put a period to this disreputable prodigality." "Mr. Hartley," said Lady Vandeleur, "I think you understand what you have to do.
May I ask you to see to it at once?"  "Stop," said the General, addressing Harry, "one word before you go." And then, turning again to Lady Vandeleur, "What is this precious fellow's errand?"
he demanded. "I trust him no further than I do yourself, let me tell you. If he had as much as the rudiments of honesty, he would scorn to stay in this house; and what he does for his wages is a mystery to all the world.
What is his errand, madam? and why are you hurrying him away?"
"I supposed you had something to say to me in private," replied the lady. "You spoke about an errand," insisted the General. "Do not attempt to deceive me in my present state of temper. You certainly spoke about an errand."
"If you insist on making your servants privy to our humiliating dissensions," replied Lady Vandeleur, "perhaps I had better ask Mr. Hartley to sit down. No?" she continued; "then you may go, Mr. Hartley. I trust you may remember all that you have heard in this room; it may be useful to you." Harry at once made his escape from the drawing-room; and as he ran upstairs he could hear the General's voice upraised in declamation, and the thin tones of Lady Vandeleur planting icy repartees at every opening. How cordially he admired the wife!
How skilfully she could evade an awkward question!
with what secure effrontery she repeated her instructions under the very guns of the enemy!
and on the other hand, how he detested the husband! There had been nothing unfamiliar in the morning's events, for he was continually in the habit of serving Lady Vandeleur on secret missions, principally connected with millinery. There was a skeleton in the house, as he well knew. The bottomless extravagance and the unknown liabilities of the wife had long since swallowed her own fortune, and threatened day by day to engulf that of the husband.
Once or twice in every year exposure and ruin seemed imminent, and Harry kept trotting round to all sorts of furnishers' shops, telling small fibs, and paying small advances on the gross amount, until another term was tided over, and the lady and her faithful secretary breathed again. For Harry, in a double capacity, was heart and soul upon that side of the war: not only did he adore Lady Vandeleur and fear and dislike her husband, but he naturally sympathized with the love of finery, and his own single extravagance was at the tailor's. He found the bandbox where it had been described, arranged his toilet with care, and left the house.
The sun shone brightly; the distance he had to travel was considerable, and he remembered with dismay that the General's sudden irruption had prevented Lady Vandeleur from giving him money for a cab. On this sultry day there was every chance that his complexion would suffer severely; and to walk through so much of London with a bandbox on his arm was a humiliation almost insupportable to a youth of his character. He paused, and took counsel with himself. The Vandeleurs lived in Eaton Place; his destination was near Notting Hill; plainly, he might cross the Park by keeping well in the open and avoiding populous alleys; and he thanked his stars when he reflected that it was still comparatively early in the day. Anxious to be rid of his incubus, he walked somewhat faster than his ordinary, and he was already some way through Kensington Gardens when, in a solitary spot among the trees, he found himself confronted by the General.
"I beg your pardon, Sir Thomas," observed Harry, politely falling on one side; for the other stood directly in his path. "Where are you going, sir?" asked the General. "I am taking a little walk among the trees," replied the lad. The General struck the bandbox with his cane.
"With that thing?" he cried; "you lie, sir, and you know you lie!" "Indeed, Sir Thomas," returned Harry, "I am not accustomed to be questioned in so high a key." "You do not understand your position," said the General. "You are my servant, and a servant of whom I have conceived the most serious suspicions.
How do I know but that your box is full of teaspoons?" "It contains a silk hat belonging to a friend," said Harry. "Very well," replied General Vandeleur. "Then I want to see your friend's silk hat.
I have," he added, grimly, "a singular curiosity for hats; and I believe you know me to be somewhat positive." "I beg your pardon, Sir Thomas, I am exceedingly grieved," Harry apologized; "but indeed this is a private affair. " The General caught him roughly by the shoulder with one hand, while he raised his cane in the most menacing manner with the other. Harry gave himself up for lost; but at the same moment Heaven vouchsafed him an unexpected defender in the person of Charlie Pendragon, who now strode forward from behind the trees.
"Come, come, General, hold your hand," said he, "this is neither courteous nor manly. " "Aha!" cried the General, wheeling round upon his new antagonist, "Mr. Pendragon! And do you suppose, Mr. Pendragon, that, because I have had the misfortune to marry your sister, I shall suffer myself to be dogged and thwarted by a discredited and bankrupt libertine like you? My acquaintance with Lady Vandeleur, sir, has taken away all my appetite for the other members of her family."
"And do you fancy, General Vandeleur," retorted Charlie, "that, because my sister has had the misfortune to marry you, she there and then forfeited her rights and privileges as a lady?
I own, sir, that by that action she did as much as anybody could to derogate from her position; but to me she is still a Pendragon. I make it my business to protect her from ungentlemanly outrage, and if you were ten times her husband I would not permit her liberty to be restrained, nor her private messengers to be violently arrested. " "How is that, Mr. Hartley?" interrogated the General. "Mr. Pendragon is of my opinion, it appears.
He too suspects that Lady Vandeleur has something to do with your friend's silk hat. " Charlie saw that he had committed an unpardonable blunder, which he hastened to repair. "How, sir?" he cried; "I suspect, do you say? I suspect nothing.
Only where I find strength abused and a man brutalizing his inferiors, I take the liberty to interfere." As he said these words he made a sign to Harry, which the latter was too dull or too much troubled to understand. "In what way am I to construe your attitude, sir?" demanded Vandeleur.
"Why, sir, as you please," returned Pendragon. The General once more raised his cane, and made a cut for Charlie's head; but the latter, lame foot and all, evaded the blow with his umbrella, ran in, and immediately closed with his formidable adversary. "Run, Harry, run!"
he cried; "run, you dolt!"
Harry stood petrified for a moment, watching the two men sway together in this fierce embrace; then he turned and took to his heels. When he cast a glance over his shoulder he saw the General prostrate under Charlie's knee, but still making desperate efforts to reverse the situation; and the Gardens seemed to have filled with people, who were running from all directions toward the scene of the fight. This spectacle lent the secretary wings; and he did not relax his pace until he had gained the Bayswater road, and plunged at random into an unfrequented by-street. To see two gentlemen of his acquaintance thus brutally mauling each other was deeply shocking to Harry. He desired to forget the sight; he desired, above all, to put as great a distance as possible between himself and General Vandeleur; and in his eagerness for this he forgot everything about his destination and hurried before him headlong and trembling.
When he remembered that Lady Vandeleur was the wife of one and the sister of the other of these gladiators, his heart was touched with sympathy for a woman so distressingly misplaced in life. Even his own situation in the General's household looked hardly so pleasing as usual in the light of these violent transactions. He had walked some little distance, busied with these meditations, before a slight collision with another passenger reminded him of the bandbox on his arm. "Heavens!" cried he, "where was my head?
and whither have I wandered?"
Thereupon he consulted the envelope which Lady Vandeleur had given him. The address was there, but without a name. Harry was simply directed to ask for "the gentleman who expected a parcel from Lady Vandeleur," and if he were not at home to await his return. The gentleman, added the note, should present a receipt in the handwriting of the lady herself.
All this seemed mightily mysterious, and Harry was above all astonished at the omission of the name and the formality of the receipt. He had thought little of this last when he heard it dropped in conversation; but reading it in cold blood, and taking it in connection with the other strange particulars, he became convinced that he was engaged in perilous affairs. For half a moment he had a doubt of Lady Vandeleur herself; for he found these obscure proceedings somewhat unworthy of so high a lady, and became more critical when her secrets were preserved against himself.
But her empire over his spirit was too complete, he dismissed his suspicions and blamed himself roundly for having so much as entertained them.
In one thing, however, his duty and interest, his generosity and his terrors, coincided to get rid of the bandbox with the greatest possible despatch. He accosted the first policeman and courteously inquired his way. It turned out that he was already not far from his destination, and a walk of a few minutes brought him to a small house in a lane, freshly painted, and kept with the most scrupulous attention. The knocker and bell-pull were highly polished; flowering pot-herbs garnished the sills of the different windows; and curtains of some rich material concealed the interior from the eyes of curious passengers.
The place had an air of repose and secrecy; and Harry was so far caught with this spirit that he knocked with more than usual discretion, and was more than usually careful to remove all impurity from his boots. A servant-maid of some personal attractions immediately opened the door, and seemed to regard the secretary with no unkind eyes. "This is the parcel from Lady Vandeleur," said Harry. "I know," replied the maid, with a nod. "But the gentleman is from home.
Will you leave it with me?" "I can not," answered Harry. "I am directed not to part with it but upon a certain condition, and I must ask you, I am afraid, to let me wait. " "Well," said she, "I suppose I may let you wait.
I am lonely enough, I can tell you, and you do not look as though you would eat a girl. But be sure and do not ask the gentleman's name, for that I am not to tell you.
" "Do you say so?" cried Harry. "Why, how strange!
But indeed for some time back I walk among surprises. One question I think I may surely ask without indiscretion: Is he the master of this house?" "He is a lodger, and not eight days old at that," returned the maid. "And now a question for a question: Do you know Lady Vandeleur?"  "I am her private secretary," replied Harry, with a glow of modest pride.
"She is pretty, is she not?" pursued the servant. "Oh, beautiful!
" cried Harry; "wonderfully lovely, and not less good and kind!" "You look kind enough yourself," she retorted; "and I wager you are worth a dozen Lady Vandeleurs." Harry was properly scandalized.
"I!"
he cried. "I am only a secretary!" "Do you mean that for me?" said the girl. "Because I am only a housemaid, if you please."
And then, relenting at the sight of Harry's obvious confusion, "I know you mean nothing of the sort," she added; "and I like your looks; but I think nothing of your Lady Vandeleur. Oh, these mistresses!"
she cried. "To send out a real gentleman like you with a bandbox in broad day!" During this talk they had remained in their original positions she on the doorstep, he on the sidewalk, bareheaded for the sake of coolness, and with the bandbox on his arm.
But upon this last speech, Harry, who was unable to support such pointblank compliments to his appearance, nor the encouraging look with which they were accompanied, began to change his attitude, and glance from left to right in perturbation.
In so doing he turned his face toward the lower end of the lane, and there, to his indescribable dismay, his eyes encountered those of General Vandeleur. The General, in a prodigious fluster of heat, hurry, and indignation, had been scouring the streets in chase of his brother-in-law; but so soon as he caught a glimpse of the delinquent secretary, his purpose changed, his anger flowed into a new channel, and he turned on his heel and came tearing up the lane with truculent gestures and vociferations. Harry made but one bolt of it into the house, driving the maid before him; and the door was slammed in his pursuer's countenance. "Is there a bar?
Will it lock?" asked Harry, while a salvo on the knocker made the house echo from wall to wall.
"Why, what is wrong with you?" asked the maid. "Is it this old gentleman?" "If he gets hold of me," whispered Harry, "I am as good as dead.
He has been pursuing me all day, carries a sword-stick, and is an Indian military officer." "These are fine manners," cried the maid. "And what, if you please, may be his name?"
"It is the General, my master," answered Harry. "He is after this bandbox.
" "Did not I tell you?" cried the maid in triumph. "I told you I thought worse than nothing of your Lady Vandeleur; and if you had an eye in your head you might see what she is for yourself. An ungrateful minx, I will be bound for that!" The General renewed his attack upon the knocker, and his passion growing with delay, began to kick and beat upon the panels of the door. "It is lucky," observed the girl, "that I am alone in the house; your General may hammer until he is weary, and there is none to open for him.
Follow me!" So saying, she led Harry into the kitchen, where she made him sit down, and stood by him herself in an affectionate attitude, with a hand upon his shoulder. The din at the door, so far from abating, continued to increase in volume, and at each blow the unhappy secretary was shaken to the heart.
"What is your name?" asked the girl. "Harry Hartley," he replied. "Mine," she went on, "is Prudence.
Do you like it?" "Very much," said Harry. "But hear for a moment how the General beats upon the door. He will certainly break it in, and then, in Heaven's name, what have I to look for but death?"  "You put yourself very much about with no occasion," answered Prudence.
"Let your General knock, he will do no more than blister his hands. Do you think I would keep you here, if I were not sure to save you? Oh, no, I am a good friend to those that please me! and we have a back door upon another lane.
But," she added, checking him, for he had got upon his feet immediately on this welcome news, "but I will not show you where it is unless you kiss me.
Will you, Harry?"  "That I will," he cried, remembering his gallantry, "not for your back door, but because you are good and pretty." And he administered two or three cordial salutes, which were returned to him in kind. Then Prudence led him to the back gate, and put her hand upon the key. "Will you come and see me?"
she asked.
"I will, indeed," said Harry. "Do not I owe you my life?" "And now," she added, opening the door, "run as hard as you can, for I shall let in the General.
" Harry scarcely required this advice; fear had him by the forelock; and he addressed himself diligently to flight. A few steps, and he believed he would escape from his trials, and return to Lady Vandeleur in honor and safety. But these few steps had not been taken before he heard a man's voice hailing him by name with many execrations, and looking over his shoulder, he beheld Charlie Pendragon waving him with both arms to return.
The shock of this new incident was so sudden and profound, and Harry was already worked into so high a state of nervous tension, that he could think of nothing better than to accelerate his pace, and continue running. He should certainly have remembered the scene in Kensington Gardens; he should certainly have concluded that, where the General was his enemy, Charlie Pendragon could be no other than a friend. But such was the fever and perturbation of his mind that he was struck by none of these considerations, and only continued to run the faster up the lane.
Charlie, by the sound of his voice and the vile terms that he hurled after the secretary, was obviously beside himself with rage. He, too, ran his very best; but, try as he might, the physical advantages were not upon his side, and his outcries and the fall of his lame foot on the macadam began to fall further and further into the wake. Harry's hopes began once more to arise. The lane was both steep and narrow, but it was exceedingly solitary, bordered on either hand by garden walls, overhung with foliage; and, for as far as the fugitive could see in front of him, there was neither a creature moving nor an open door. Providence, weary of persecution, was now offering him an open field for his escape.
Alas!
as he came abreast of a garden door under a tuft of chestnuts, it was suddenly drawn back, and he could see inside, upon a garden path, the figure of a butcher's boy with his tray upon his arm. He had hardly recognized the fact before he was some steps beyond upon the other side. But the fellow had had time to observe him; he was evidently much surprised to see a gentleman go by at so unusual a pace; and he came out into the lane and began to call after Harry with shouts of ironical encouragement.
His appearance gave a new idea to Charlie Pendragon, who, although he was now sadly out of breath, once more upraised his voice. "Stop thief!" he cried. And immediately the butcher's boy had taken up the cry and joined in the pursuit.
This was a bitter moment for the hunted secretary. It is true that his terror enabled him once more to improve his pace, and gain with every step on his pursuers; but he was well aware that he was near the end of his resources, and should he meet any one coming the other way, his predicament in the narrow lane would be desperate indeed. "I must find a place of concealment," he thought, "and that within the next few seconds, or all is over with me in this world." Scarcely had the thought crossed his mind than the lane took a sudden turning; and he found himself hidden from his enemies.
There are circumstances in which even the least energetic of mankind learn to behave with vigor and decision; and the most cautious forget their prudence and embrace foolhardy resolutions. This was one of those occasions for Harry Hartley; and those who knew him best would have been the most astonished at the lad's audacity. He stopped dead, flung the bandbox over a garden wall; and leaping upward with incredible agility and seizing the copestone with his hands, he tumbled headlong after it into the garden. He came to himself a moment afterward, seated in a border of small rose-bushes. His hands and knees were cut and bleeding, for the wall had been protected against such an escalade by a liberal provision of old bottles; and he was conscious of a general dislocation and a painful swimming in the head.
Facing him across the garden, which was in admirable order, and set with flowers of the most delicious perfume, he beheld the back of a house. It was of considerable extent, and plainly habitable; but, in odd contrast to the grounds, it was crazy, ill-kept, and of a mean appearance. On all other sides the circuit of the garden wall appeared unbroken. He took in these features of the scene with mechanical glances, but his mind was still unable to piece together or draw a rational conclusion from what he saw.
And when he heard footsteps advancing on the gravel, although he turned his eyes in that direction, it was with no thought either for defense or flight. The newcomer was a large, coarse, and very sordid personage, in gardening clothes, and with a watering-pot in his left hand. One less confused would have been affected with some alarm at the sight of this man's huge proportions and black and lowering eyes. But Harry was too gravely shaken by his fall to be so much as terrified; and if he was unable to divert his glances from the gardener, he remained absolutely passive, and suffered him to draw near, to take him by the shoulder, and to plant him roughly on his feet, without a motion of resistance.
For a moment the two stared into each other's eyes, Harry fascinated, the man filled with wrath and a cruel, sneering humor. "Who are you?" he demanded at last. "Who are you to come flying over my wall and break my Gloire de Dijons?
What is your name?" he added, shaking him; "and what may be your business here?" Harry could not as much as proffer a word in explanation. But just at that moment Pendragon and the butcher's boy went clumping past, and the sound of their feet and their hoarse cries echoed loudly in the narrow lane.
The gardener had received his answer; and he looked down into Harry's face with an obnoxious smile. "A thief!"
he said. "Upon my word, and a very good thing you must make of it; for I see you dressed like a gentleman from top to toe. Are you not ashamed to go about the world in such a trim, with honest folk, I dare say, glad to buy your cast-off finery second-hand.
Speak up, you dog," the man went on; "you can understand English, I suppose; and I mean to have a bit of talk with you before I march you to the station. " "Indeed, sir," said Harry, "this is all a dreadful misconception; and if you will go with me to Sir Thomas Vandeleur's in Eaton Place, I can promise that all will be made plain. The most upright person, as I now perceive, can be led into suspicious positions." "My little man," replied the gardener, "I will go with you no further than the station-house in the next street.
The inspector, no doubt, will be glad to take a stroll with you as far as Eaton Place, and have a bit of afternoon tea with your great acquaintances. Or would you prefer to go direct to the Home Secretary? Sir Thomas Vandeleur, indeed!
Perhaps you think I don't know a gentleman when I see one from a common run-the-hedge like you? Clothes or no clothes, I can read you like a book. Here is a shirt that maybe cost as much as my Sunday hat; and that coat, I take it, has never seen the inside of Rag-fair, and then your boots "  The man, whose eyes had fallen upon the ground, stopped short in his insulting commentary, and remained for a moment looking intently upon something at his feet. When he spoke his voice was strangely altered.
"What, in God's name," said he, "is all this?"  Harry, following the direction of the man's eyes, beheld a spectacle that struck him dumb with terror and amazement. In his fall he had descended vertically upon the bandbox and burst it open from end to end; thence a great treasure of diamonds had poured forth, and now lay abroad, part trodden in the soil, part scattered on the surface in regal and glittering profusion. There was a magnificent coronet which he had often admired on Lady Vandeleur; there were rings and brooches, ear-drops and bracelets, and even unset brilliants rolling here and there among the rose-bushes like drops of morning dew. A princely fortune lay between the two men upon the ground a fortune in the most inviting, solid, and durable form, capable of being carried in an apron, beautiful in itself, and scattering the sunlight in a million rainbow flashes.
"Good God!" said Harry, "I am lost!" His mind raced backward into the past with the incalculable velocity of thought, and he began to comprehend his day's adventures, to conceive them as a whole, and to recognize the sad imbroglio in which his own character and fortunes had become involved. He looked round him as if for help, but he was alone in the garden, with his scattered diamonds and his redoubtable interlocutor; and when he gave ear, there was no sound but the rustle of the leaves and the hurried pulsation of his heart. It was little wonder if the young man felt himself deserted by his spirits, and with a broken voice repeated his last ejaculation:  "I am lost!"
The gardener peered in all directions with an air of guilt; but there was no face at any of the windows, and he seemed to breathe again. "Pick up a heart," he said, "you fool!
The worst of it is done. Why could you not say at first there was enough for two?  Two?" he repeated, "aye, and for two hundred! But come away from here, where we may be observed; and, for the love of wisdom, straighten out your hat and brush your clothes.
You could not travel two steps the figure of fun you look just now." While Harry mechanically adopted these suggestions, the gardener, getting upon his knees, hastily drew together the scattered jewels and returned them to the bandbox. The touch of these costly crystals sent a shiver of emotion through the man's stalwart frame; his face was transfigured, and his eyes shone with concupiscence; indeed it seemed as if he luxuriously prolonged his occupation, and dallied with every diamond that he handled. At last, however, it was done; and, concealing the bandbox in his smock, the gardener beckoned to Harry and preceded him in the direction of the house.
Near the door they were met by a young man evidently in holy orders, dark and strikingly handsome, with a look of mingled weakness and resolution, and very neatly attired after the manner of his caste. The gardener was plainly annoyed by this encounter; but he put as good a face upon it as he could, and accosted the clergyman with an obsequious and smiling air. "Here is a fine afternoon, Mr. Rolles," said he: "a fine afternoon, as sure as God made it! And here is a young friend of mine who had a fancy to look at my roses.
I took the liberty to bring him in, for I thought none of the lodgers would object." "Speaking for myself," replied the Reverend Mr. Rolles, "I do not; nor do I fancy any of the rest of us would be more difficult upon so small a matter. The garden is your own, Mr. Raeburn; we must none of us forget that; and because you give us liberty to walk there we should be indeed ungracious if we so far presumed upon your politeness as to interfere with the convenience of your friends.
But, on second thoughts," he added, "I believe that this gentleman and I have met before.
Mr. Hartley, I think. I regret to observe that you have had a fall." And he offered his hand. A sort of maiden dignity and a desire to delay as long as possible the necessity for explanation moved Harry to refuse this chance of help, and to deny his own identity.
He chose the tender mercies of the gardener, who was at least unknown to him, rather than the curiosity and perhaps the doubts of an acquaintance. "I fear there is some mistake," said he. "My name is Thomlinson and I am a friend of Mr. Raeburn's. " "Indeed?" said Mr. Rolles.
"The likeness is amazing. " Mr. Raeburn, who had been upon thorns throughout this colloquy, now felt it high time to bring it to a period. "I wish you a pleasant saunter, sir," said he. And with that he dragged Harry after him into the house, and then into a chamber on the garden.
His first care was to draw down the blind, for Mr. Rolles still remained where they had left him, in an attitude of perplexity and thought. Then he emptied the broken bandbox on the table, and stood before the treasure, thus fully displayed, with an expression of rapturous greed, and rubbing his hands upon his thighs. For Harry, the sight of the man's face under the influence of this base emotion, added another pang to those he was already suffering. It seemed incredible that, from his life of pure and delicate trifling, he should be plunged in a breath among sordid and criminal relations.
He could reproach his conscience with no sinful act; and yet he was now suffering the punishment of sin in its most acute and cruel forms the dread of punishment, the suspicions of the good, and the companionship and contamination of vile and brutal natures. He felt he could lay his life down with gladness to escape from the room and the society of Mr. Raeburn. "And now," said the latter, after he had separated the jewels into two nearly equal parts, and drawn one of them nearer to himself; "and now," said he, "everything in this world has to be paid for, and some things sweetly. You must know, Mr. Hartley, if such be your name, that I am a man of a very easy temper, and good nature has been my stumbling-block from first to last.
I could pocket the whole of these pretty pebbles, if I chose, and I should like to see you dare to say a word; but I think I must have taken a liking to you; for I declare I have not the heart to shave you so close. So, do you see, in pure kind feeling, I propose that we divide; and these," indicating the two heaps, "are the proportions that seem to me just and friendly. Do you see any objection, Mr. Hartley, may I ask? I am not the man to stick upon a brooch."
"But, sir," cried Harry, "what you propose to me is impossible. The jewels are not mine, and I can not share what is another's, no matter with whom, nor in what proportions. " "They are not yours, are they not?" returned Raeburn.
"And you could not share them with anybody, couldn't you? Well now, that is what I call a pity; for here am I obliged to take you to the station. The police think of that," he continued; "think of the disgrace for your respectable parents; think," he went on, taking Harry by the wrist; "think of the Colonies and the Day of Judgment."
"I can not help it," wailed Harry. "It is not my fault. You will not come with me to Eaton Place?" "No," replied the man, "I will not, that is certain.
And I mean to divide these playthings with you here." And so saying he applied a sudden and severe torsion to the lad's wrist. Harry could not suppress a scream, and the perspiration burst forth upon his face. Perhaps pain and terror quickened his intelligence, but certainly at that moment the whole business flashed across him in another light; and he saw that there was nothing for it but to accede to the ruffian's proposal, and trust to find the house and force him to disgorge, under more favorable circumstances, and when he himself was clear from all suspicion.
"I agree," he said. "There is a lamb," sneered the gardener. "I thought you would recognize your interests at last. This bandbox," he continued, "I shall burn with my rubbish; it is a thing that curious folk might recognize; and as for you, scrape up your gaieties and put them in your pocket. " Harry proceeded to obey, Raeburn watching him, and every now and again, his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation, abstracting another jewel from the secretary's share, and adding it to his own.
When this was finished, both proceeded to the front door, which Raeburn cautiously opened to observe the street. This was apparently clear of passengers; for he suddenly seized Harry by the nape of the neck, and holding his face downward so that he could see nothing but the roadway and the doorsteps of the houses, pushed him violently before him down one street and up another for the space of perhaps a minute and a half. Harry had counted three corners before the bully relaxed his grasp, and crying, "Now be off with you!"
sent the lad flying headforemost with a well-directed and athletic kick. When Harry gathered himself up, half-stunned and bleeding freely at the nose, Mr. Raeburn had entirely disappeared.
For the first time, anger and pain so completely overcame the lad's spirits that he burst into a fit of tears and remained sobbing in the middle of the road. After he had thus somewhat assuaged his emotion, he began to look about him and read the names of the streets at whose intersection he had been deserted by the gardener. He was still in an unfrequented portion of West London, among villas and large gardens; but he could see some persons at a window who had evidently witnessed his misfortune; and almost immediately after a servant came running from the house and offered him a glass of water. At the same time, a dirty rogue, who had been slouching somewhere in the neighborhood, drew near him from the other side.
"Poor fellow," said the maid, "how vilely you have been handled, to be sure! Why, your knees are all cut, and your clothes ruined! Do you know the wretch who used you so?"
"That I do!" cried Harry, who was somewhat refreshed by the water; "and shall run him home in spite of his precautions. He shall pay dearly for this day's work, I promise you."
"You had better come into the house and have yourself washed and brushed," continued the maid. "My mistress will make you welcome, never fear. And see, I will pick up your hat.
Why, love of mercy!
" she screamed, "if you have not dropped diamonds all over the street!" Such was the case; a good half of what remained to him, after the depredations of Mr. Raeburn, had been shaken out of his pockets by the somersault and once more lay glittering on the ground. He blessed his fortune that the maid had been so quick of eye; "there is nothing so bad but it might be worse," thought he; and the recovery of these few seemed to him almost as great an affair as the loss of all the rest.
But, alas!
as he stooped to pick up his treasures, the loiterer made a rapid onslaught, overset both Harry and the maid with a movement of his arms, swept up a double handful of the diamonds, and made off along the street with an amazing swiftness.
Harry, as soon as he could get upon his feet, gave chase to the miscreant with many cries, but the latter was too fleet of foot, and probably too well acquainted with the locality; for turn where the pursuer would he could find no traces of the fugitive. In the deepest despondency, Harry revisited the scene of his mishap, where the maid, who was still waiting, very honestly returned him his hat and the remainder of the fallen diamonds. Harry thanked her from his heart, and being now in no humor for economy, made his way to the nearest cabstand and set off for Eaton Place by coach. The house, on his arrival, seemed in some confusion, as if a catastrophe had happened in the family; and the servants clustered together in the hall, and were unable, or perhaps not altogether anxious, to suppress their merriment at the tatterdemalion figure of the secretary. He passed them with as good an air of dignity as he could assume, and made directly for the boudoir.
When he opened the door an astonishing and even menacing spectacle presented itself to his eyes; for he beheld the General and his wife, and, of all people, Charlie Pendragon, closeted together and speaking with earnestness and gravity on some important subject. Harry saw at once that there was little left for him to explain plenary confession had plainly been made to the General of the intended fraud upon his pocket, and the unfortunate miscarriage of the scheme; and they had all made common cause against a common danger. "Thank Heaven!" cried Lady Vandeleur, "here he is!
The bandbox, Harry the bandbox!"
But Harry stood before them silent and downcast.
"Speak!" she cried. "Speak!
Where is the bandbox?" And the men, with threatening gestures, repeated the demand.
Harry drew a handful of jewels from his pocket. He was very white. "This is all that remains," said he.
"I declare before Heaven it was through no fault of mine; and if you will have patience, although some are lost, I am afraid, forever, others, I am sure, may be still recovered." "Alas!" cried Lady Vandeleur, "all our diamonds are gone, and I owe ninety thousand pounds for dress!"
"Madam," said the General, "you might have paved the gutter with your own trash; you might have made debts to fifty times the sum you mention; you might have robbed me of my mother's coronet and ring; and Nature might have still so far prevailed that I could have forgiven you at last. But, madam, you have taken the Rajah's Diamond the Eye of Light, as the Orientals poetically termed it the Pride of Kashgar!
You have taken from me the Rajah's Diamond," he cried, raising his hands, "and all, madam, all is at an end between us!" "Believe me, General Vandeleur," she replied, "that is one of the most agreeable speeches that ever I heard from your lips; and since we are to be ruined, I could almost welcome the change, if it delivers me from you. You have told me often enough that I married you for your money; let me tell you now that I always bitterly repented the bargain; and if you were still marriageable, and had a diamond bigger than your head, I should counsel even my maid against a union so uninviting and disastrous. As for you, Mr. Hartley," she continued, turning on the secretary, "you have sufficiently exhibited your valuable qualities in this house; we are now persuaded that you equally lack manhood, sense, and self-respect; and I can see only one course open for you to withdraw instanter, and, if possible, return no more.
For your wages you may rank as a creditor in my late husband's bankruptcy. " Harry had scarcely comprehended this insulting address before the General was down upon him with another. "And in the meantime," said that personage, "follow me before the nearest Inspector of Police.
You may impose upon a simple-minded soldier, sir, but the eye of the law will read your disreputable secret. If I must spend my old age in poverty through your underhand intriguing with my wife, I mean at least that you shall not remain unpunished for your pains; and God, sir, will deny me a very considerable satisfaction if you do not pick oakum from now until your dying day. " With that, the General dragged Harry from the apartment, and hurried him downstairs and along the street to the police-station of the district. [Here, says my Arabian author, ended this deplorable business of the bandbox.
But to the unfortunate secretary the whole affair was the beginning of a new and manlier life.
The police were easily persuaded of his innocence; and, after he had given what help he could in the subsequent investigations, he was even complimented by one of the chiefs of the detective department on the probity and simplicity of his behavior. Several persons interested themselves in one so unfortunate; and soon after he inherited a sum of money from a maiden aunt in Worcestershire. With this he married Prudence, and set sail for Bendigo, or according to another account, for Trincomalee, exceedingly content, and with the best of prospects.]    STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN IN HOLY ORDERS  The Reverend Mr. Simon Rolles had distinguished himself in the Moral Sciences, and was more than usually proficient in the study of Divinity.
His essay "On the Christian Doctrine of the Social Obligations" obtained for him, at the moment of its production, a certain celebrity in the University of Oxford; and it was understood in clerical and learned circles that young Mr. Rolles had in contemplation a considerable work a folio, it was said on the authority of the Fathers of the Church. These attainments, these ambitious designs, however, were far from helping him to any preferment; and he was still in quest of his first curacy when a chance ramble in that part of London, the peaceful and rich aspect of the garden, a desire for solitude and study, and the cheapness of the lodging, led him to take up his abode with Mr. Raeburn, the nurseryman of Stockdove Lane. It was his habit every afternoon, after he had worked seven or eight hours on St. Ambrose or St. Chrysostom, to walk for a while in meditation among the roses. And this was usually one of the most productive moments of his day.
But even a sincere appetite for thought, and the excitement of grave problems awaiting solution, are not always sufficient to preserve the mind of the philosopher against the petty shocks and contacts of the world.
And when Mr. Rolles found General Vandeleur's secretary, ragged and bleeding, in the company of his landlord; when he saw both change color and seek to avoid his questions; and, above all, when the former denied his own identity with the most unmoved assurance, he speedily forgot the Saints and Fathers in the vulgar interest of curiosity. "I can not be mistaken," thought he. "That is Mr. Hartley beyond a doubt.
How comes he in such a pickle? why does he deny his name?
and what can be his business with that black-looking ruffian, my landlord?"
As he was thus reflecting, another peculiar circumstance attracted his attention. The face of Mr. Raeburn appeared at a low window next the door; and, as chance directed, his eyes met those of Mr. Rolles. The nurseryman seemed disconcerted, and even alarmed; and immediately after the blind of the apartment was pulled sharply down.
"This may all be very well," reflected Mr. Rolles; "it may be all excellently well; but I confess freely that I do not think so. Suspicious, underhand, untruthful, fearful of observation I believe upon my soul," he thought, "the pair are plotting some disgraceful action." The detective that there is in all of us awoke and became clamant in the bosom of Mr. Rolles; and with a brisk, eager step, that bore no resemblance to his usual gait, he proceeded to make the circuit of the garden.
When he came to the scene of Harry's escalade, his eye was at once arrested by a broken rose-bush and marks of trampling on the mold. He looked up, and saw scratches on the brick, and a rag of trouser floating from a broken bottle. This, then, was the mode of entrance chosen by Mr. Raeburn's particular friend! It was thus that General Vandeleur's secretary came to admire a flower-garden!
The young clergyman whistled softly to himself as he stooped to examine the ground. He could make out where Harry had landed from his perilous leap; he recognized the flat foot of Mr. Raeburn where it had sunk deeply in the soil as he pulled up the secretary by the collar; nay, on a closer inspection, he seemed to distinguish the marks of groping fingers, as though something had been spilled abroad and eagerly collected. "Upon my word," he thought, "the thing grows vastly interesting.
" And just then he caught sight of something almost entirely buried in the earth. In an instant he had disinterred a dainty morocco case, ornamented and clasped in gilt. It had been trodden heavily underfoot, and thus escaped the hurried search of Mr. Raeburn.
Mr. Rolles opened the case, and drew a long breath of almost horrified astonishment; for there lay before him, in a cradle of green velvet, a diamond of prodigious magnitude and of the finest water. It was of the bigness of a duck's egg; beautifully shaped, and without a flaw; and as the sun shone upon it, it gave forth a lustre like that of electricity, and seemed to burn in his hand with a thousand internal fires. He knew little of precious stones; but the Rajah's Diamond was a wonder that explained itself; a village child, if he found it, would run screaming for the nearest cottage; and a savage would prostrate himself in adoration before so imposing a fetish.
The beauty of the stone flattered the young clergyman's eyes; the thought of its incalculable value overpowered his intellect. He knew that what he held in his hand was worth more than many years' purchase of an archiepiscopal see; that it would build cathedrals more stately than Ely or Cologne; that he who possessed it was set free forever from the primal curse, and might follow his own inclinations without concern or hurry, without let or hindrance. And as he suddenly turned it, the rays leaped forth again with renewed brilliancy, and seemed to pierce his very heart.
Decisive actions are often taken in a moment and without any conscious deliverance from the rational parts of man. So it was now with Mr. Rolles. He glanced hurriedly round; beheld, like Mr. Raeburn before him, nothing but the sunlit flower-garden, the tall treetops, and the house with blinded windows; and in a trice he had shut the case, thrust it into his pocket, and was hastening to his study with the speed of guilt.
The Reverend Simon Rolles had stolen the Rajah's Diamond. Early in the afternoon the police arrived with Harry Hartley. The nurseryman, who was beside himself with terror, readily discovered his hoard; and the jewels were identified and inventoried in the presence of the secretary.
As for Mr. Rolles, he showed himself in a most obliging temper, communicated what he knew with freedom, and professed regret that he could do no more to help the officers in their duty. "Still," he added, "I suppose your business is nearly at an end." "By no means," replied the man from Scotland Yard; and he narrated the second robbery of which Harry had been the immediate victim, and gave the young clergyman a description of the more important jewels that were still not found, dilating particularly on the Rajah's Diamond. "It must be worth a fortune," observed Mr. Rolles.
"Ten fortunes twenty fortunes," cried the officer. "The more it is worth," remarked Simon shrewdly, "the more difficult it must be to sell. Such a thing has a physiognomy not to be disguised, and I should fancy a man might as easily negotiate St. Paul's Cathedral."
"Oh, truly!" said the officer; "but if the thief be a man of any intelligence, he will cut it into three or four, and there will be still enough to make him rich." "Thank you," said the clergyman. "You can not imagine how much your conversation interests me." Whereupon the functionary admitted that they knew many strange things in his profession, and immediately after took his leave. Mr. Rolles regained his apartment.
It seemed smaller and barer than usual; the materials for his great work had never presented so little interest; and he looked upon his library with the eye of scorn. He took down, volume by volume, several Fathers of the Church, and glanced them through; but they contained nothing to his purpose. "These old gentlemen," thought he, "are no doubt very valuable writers, but they seem to me conspicuously ignorant of life. Here am I, with learning enough to be a Bishop, and I positively do not know how to dispose of a stolen diamond.
I glean a hint from a common policeman, and, with all my folios, I can not so much as put it into execution. This inspires me with very low ideas of University training." Herewith he kicked over his book-shelf and, putting on his hat, hastened from the house to the club of which he was a member. In such a place of mundane resort he hoped to find some man of good counsel and a shrewd experience in life.
In the reading-room he saw many of the country clergy and an Archdeacon; there were three journalists and a writer upon the Higher Metaphysic, playing pool; and at dinner only the raff of ordinary club frequenters showed their commonplace and obliterated countenances. None of these, thought Mr. Rolles, would know more on dangerous topics than he knew himself; none of them were fit to give him guidance in his present strait. At length, in the smoking-room, up many weary stairs, he hit upon a gentleman of somewhat portly build and dressed with conspicuous plainness. He was smoking a cigar and reading the "Fortnightly Review"; his face was singularly free from all sign of preoccupation or fatigue; and there was something in his air which seemed to invite confidence and to expect submission. The more the young clergyman scrutinized his features, the more he was convinced that he had fallen on one capable of giving pertinent advice.
"Sir," said he, "you will excuse my abruptness; but I judge you from your appearance to be preeminently a man of the world." "I have indeed considerable claims to that distinction," replied the stranger, laying aside his magazine with a look of mingled amusement and surprise. "I, sir," continued the Curate, "am a recluse, a student, a creature of ink-bottles and patristic folios. A recent event has brought my folly vividly before my eyes, and I desire to instruct myself in life.
By life," he added, "I do not mean Thackeray's novels; but the crimes and secret possibilities of our society, and the principles of wise conduct among exceptional events. I am a patient reader; can the thing be learned in books?" "You put me in a difficulty," said the stranger.
"I confess I have no great notion of the use of books, except to amuse a railway journey; although, I believe, there are some very exact treatises on astronomy, the use of the globes, agriculture, and the art of making paper-flowers. Upon the less apparent provinces of life I fear you will find nothing truthful. Yet stay," he added, "have you read Gaboriau?"
Mr. Rolles admitted he had never even heard the name. "You may gather some notions from Gaboriau," resumed the stranger. "He is at least suggestive; and as he is an author much studied by Prince Bismarck, you will, at the worst, lose your time in good society." "Sir," said the Curate, "I am infinitely obliged by your politeness.
" "You have already more than repaid me," returned the other. "How?" inquired Simon. "By the novelty of your request," replied the gentleman; and with a polite gesture, as though to ask permission, he resumed the study of the "Fortnightly Review.
" On his way home Mr. Rolles purchased a work on precious stones and several of Gaboriau's novels. These last he eagerly skimmed until an advanced hour in the morning; but although they introduced him to many new ideas, he could nowhere discover what to do with a stolen diamond. He was annoyed, moreover, to find the information scattered among romantic story-telling, instead of soberly set forth after the manner of a manual; and he concluded that, even if the writer had thought much upon these subjects, he was totally lacking in educational method. For the character and attainments of Lecoq, however, he was unable to contain his admiration.
"He was truly a great creature," ruminated Mr. Rolles. "He knew the world as I know Paley's Evidences. There was nothing that he could not carry to a termination with his own hand, and against the largest odds.  Heavens!"
he broke out suddenly, "is not this the lesson? Must I not learn to cut diamonds for myself?"
It seemed to him as if he had sailed at once out of his perplexities; he remembered that he knew a jeweler, one B. Macculloch, in Edinburgh, who would be glad to put him in the way of the necessary training; a few months, perhaps a few years, of sordid toil, and he would be sufficiently expert to divide and sufficiently cunning to dispose with advantage of the Rajah's Diamond. That done, he might return to pursue his researches at leisure, a wealthy and luxurious student, envied and respected by all. Golden visions attended him through his slumber, and he awoke refreshed and light-hearted with the morning sun. Mr. Raeburn's house was on that day to be closed by the police, and this afforded a pretext for his departure.
He cheerfully prepared his baggage, transported it to King's Cross, where he left it in the cloak room, and returned to the club to while away the afternoon and dine. "If you dine here to-day, Rolles," observed an acquaintance, "you may see two of the most remarkable men in England Prince Florizel of Bohemia and old Jack Vandeleur. " "I have heard of the Prince," replied Mr. Rolles; "and General Vandeleur I have even met in society. " "General Vandeleur is an ass!" returned the other. "This is his brother John, the biggest adventurer, the best judge of precious stones, and one of the most acute diplomatists in Europe.
Have you never heard of his duel with the Duc de Val d'Orge? of his exploits and atrocities when he was Dictator of Paraguay? of his dexterity in recovering Sir Samuel Levi's jewelry?
nor of his services in the Indian Mutiny services by which the Government profited, but which the Government dared not recognize? You make me wonder what we mean by fame, or even by infamy; for Jack Vandeleur has prodigious claims to both. Run downstairs," he continued, "take a table near them, and keep your ears open.
You will hear some strange talk, or I am much misled." "But how shall I know them?" inquired the clergyman. "Know them!" cried his friend; "why, the Prince is the finest gentleman in Europe, the only living creature who looks like a king; and as for Jack Vandeleur, if you can imagine Ulysses at seventy years of age, and with a sabre-cut across his face, you have the man before you!
Know them, indeed! Why, you could pick either of them out of a Derby day!"
Rolles eagerly hurried to the dining-room. It was as his friend had asserted; it was impossible to mistake the pair in question. Old John Vandeleur was of a remarkable force of body, and obviously broken to the most difficult exercises. He had neither the carriage of a swordsman, nor of a sailor, nor yet of one much inured to the saddle; but something made up of all these, and the result and expression of many different habits and dexterities. His features were bold and aquiline; his expression arrogant and predatory; his whole appearance that of a swift, violent, unscrupulous man of action; and his copious white hair and the deep sabre-cut that traversed his nose and temple added a note of savagery to a head already remarkable and menacing in itself.
In his companion, the Prince of Bohemia, Mr. Rolles was astonished to recognize the gentleman who had recommended him the study of Gaboriau.
Doubtless Prince Florizel, who rarely visited the club, of which, as of most others, he was an honorary member, had been waiting for John Vandeleur when Simon accosted him on the previous evening. The other diners had modestly retired into the angles of the room, and left the distinguished pair in a certain isolation, but the young clergyman was unrestrained by any sentiment of awe, and, marching boldly up, took his place at the nearest table. The conversation was, indeed, new to the student's ears.
The ex-Dictator of Paraguay stated many extraordinary experiences in different quarters of the world; and the Prince supplied a commentary which, to a man of thought, was even more interesting than the events themselves. Two forms of experience were thus brought together and laid before the young clergyman; and he did not know which to admire the most the desperate actor, or the skilled expert in life; the man who spoke boldly of his own deeds and perils, or the man who seemed, like a god, to know all things and to have suffered nothing. The manner of each aptly fitted with his part in the discourse.
The Dictator indulged in brutalities alike of speech and gesture; his hand opened and shut and fell roughly on the table; and his voice was loud and heady. The Prince, on the other hand, seemed the very type of urbane docility and quiet; the least movement, the least inflection, had with him a weightier significance than all the shouts and pantomime of his companion; and if ever, as must frequently have been the case, he described some experience personal to himself, it was so aptly dissimulated as to pass unnoticed with the rest. At length the talk wandered on to the late robberies and the Rajah's Diamond. "That diamond would be better in the sea," observed Prince Florizel. "As a Vandeleur," replied the Dictator, "your Highness may imagine my dissent."
"I speak on grounds of public policy," pursued the Prince. "Jewels so valuable should be reserved for the collection of a Prince or the treasury of a great nation. To hand them about among the common sort of men is to set a price on Virtue's head; and if the Rajah of Kashgar a Prince, I understand, of great enlightenment desired vengeance upon the men of Europe, he could hardly have gone more efficaciously about his purpose than by sending us this apple of discord. There is no honesty too robust for such a trial.
I myself, who have many duties and many privileges of my own I myself, Mr. Vandeleur, could scarce handle the intoxicating crystal and be safe. As for you, who are a diamond-hunter by taste and profession, I do not believe there is a crime in the calendar you would not perpetrate I do not believe you have a friend in the world whom you would not eagerly betray I do not know if you have a family, but if you have I declare you would sacrifice your children and all this for what? Not to be richer, nor to have more comforts or more respect, but simply to call this diamond yours for a year or two until you die, and now and again to open a safe and look at it as one looks at a picture." "It is true," replied Vandeleur.
"I have hunted most things, from men and women down to mosquitoes; I have dived for coral; I have followed both whales and tigers; and a diamond is the tallest quarry of the lot. It has beauty and worth; it alone can properly reward the ardors of the chase. At this moment, as your Highness may fancy, I am upon the trail; I have a sure knack, a wide experience; I know every stone of price in my brother's collection as a shepherd knows his sheep; and I wish I may die if I do not recover them every one!" "Sir Thomas Vandeleur will have great cause to thank you," said the Prince.
"I am not so sure," returned the Dictator, with a laugh. "One of the Vandeleurs will. Thomas or John Peter or Paul we are all apostles." "I did not catch your observation," said the Prince with some disgust.
And at the same moment the waiter informed Mr. Vandeleur that his cab was at the door. Mr. Rolles glanced at the clock, and saw that he also must be moving; and the coincidence struck him sharply and unpleasantly, for he desired to see no more of the diamond-hunter. Much study having somewhat shaken the young man's nerves, he was in the habit of traveling in the most luxurious manner; and for the present journey he had taken a sofa in the sleeping carriage.
"You will be very comfortable," said the guard; "there is no one in your compartment, and only one old gentleman in the other end. " It was close upon the hour, and the tickets were being examined, when Mr. Rolles beheld this other fellow-passenger ushered by several porters into his place; certainly, there was not another man in the world whom he would not have preferred for it was old John Vandeleur, the ex-Dictator. The sleeping carriages on the Great Northern line were divided into three compartments one at each end for travelers, and one in the centre fitted with the conveniences of a lavatory. A door running in grooves separated each of the others from the lavatory; but as there were neither bolts nor locks, the whole suite was practically common ground.
When Mr. Rolles had studied his position, he perceived himself without defense. If the Dictator chose to pay him a visit in the course of the night, he could do no less than receive it; he had no means of fortification, and lay open to attack as if he had been lying in the fields. This situation caused him some agony of mind. He recalled with alarm the boastful statements of his fellow-traveler across the dining-table, and the professions of immorality which he had heard him offering to the disgusted Prince. Some persons, he remembered to have read, are endowed with a singular quickness of perception for the neighborhood of precious metals; through walls and even at considerable distances they are said to divine the presence of gold.
Might it not be the same with diamonds?
he wondered; and if so, who was more likely to enjoy this transcendental sense than the person who gloried in the appellation of the Diamond Hunter? From such a man he recognized that he had everything to fear, and longed eagerly for the arrival of the day. In the meantime he neglected no precaution, concealed his diamond in the most internal pocket of a system of greatcoats, and devoutly recommended himself to the care of Providence. The train pursued its usual even and rapid course; and nearly half the journey had been accomplished before slumber began to triumph over uneasiness in the breast of Mr. Rolles.
For some time he resisted its influence; but it grew upon him more and more, and a little before York he was fain to stretch himself upon one of the couches and suffer his eyes to close; and almost at the same instant consciousness deserted the young clergyman. His last thought was of his terrifying neighbor. When he awoke it was still pitch dark except for the flicker of the veiled lamp; and the continual roaring and oscillation testified to the unrelaxed velocity of the train. He sat upright in a panic, for he had been tormented by the most uneasy dreams; it was some seconds before he recovered his self-command; and even after he had resumed a recumbent attitude sleep continued to flee him, and he lay awake with his brain in a state of violent agitation, and his eyes fixed upon the lavatory door. He pulled his clerical felt hat over his brow still further to shield him from the light; and he adopted the usual expedients, such as counting a thousand or banishing thought, by which experienced invalids are accustomed to woo the approach of sleep.
In the case of Mr. Rolles they proved one and all vain; he was harassed by a dozen different anxieties the old man in the other end of the carriage haunted him in the most alarming shapes; and in whatever attitude he chose to lie the diamond in his pocket occasioned him a sensible physical distress. It burned, it was too large, it bruised his ribs; and there were infinitesimal fractions of a second in which he had half a mind to throw it from the window. While he was thus lying, a strange incident took place. The sliding-door into the lavatory stirred a little, and then a little more, and was finally drawn back for the space of about twenty inches. The lamp in the lavatory was unshaded, and in the lighted aperture thus disclosed Mr. Rolles could see the head of Mr. Vandeleur in an attitude of deep attention.
He was conscious that the gaze of the Dictator rested intently on his own face and the instinct of self-preservation moved him to hold his breath, to refrain from the least movement, and keeping his eyes lowered, to watch his visitor from underneath the lashes. After about a moment the head was withdrawn and the door of the lavatory replaced. The Dictator had not come to attack, but to observe; his action was not that of a man threatening another, but that of a man who was himself threatened; if Mr. Rolles was afraid of him, it appeared that he, in his turn, was not quite easy on the score of Mr. Rolles.
He had come, it would seem, to make sure that his only fellow-traveler was asleep; and, when satisfied on that point, he had at once withdrawn. The clergyman leaped to his feet. The extreme of terror had given place to a reaction of foolhardy daring. He reflected that the rattle of the flying train concealed all other sounds, and determined, come what might, to return the visit he had just received.
Divesting himself of his cloak, which might have interfered with the freedom of his action, he entered the lavatory and paused to listen. As he had expected, there was nothing to be heard above the roar of the train's progress; and laying his hand on the door at the further side, he proceeded cautiously to draw it back for about six inches. Then he stopped, and could not contain an ejaculation of surprise.
John Vandeleur wore a fur traveling cap with lappets to protect his ears; and this may have combined with the sound of the express to keep him in ignorance of what was going forward. It is certain, at least, that he did not raise his head, but continued without interruption to pursue his strange employment. Between his feet stood an open hat-box; in one hand he held the sleeve of his sealskin greatcoat; in the other a formidable knife, with which he had just slit up the lining of the sleeve.
Mr. Rolles had read of persons carrying money in a belt; and as he had no acquaintance with any but cricket-belts, he had never been able rightly to conceive how this was managed. But here was a stranger thing before his eyes; for John Vandeleur, it appeared, carried diamonds in the lining of his sleeve; and even as the young clergyman gazed, he could see one glittering brilliant drop after another into the hat-box.
He stood riveted to the spot, following this unusual business with his eyes. The diamonds were, for the most part, small, and not easily distinguishable either in shape or fire. Suddenly the Dictator appeared to find a difficulty; he employed both hands and stopped over his task; but it was not until after considerable maneuvring that he extricated a large tiara of diamonds from the lining, and held it up for some seconds' examination before he placed it with the others in the hat-box. The tiara was a ray of light to Mr. Rolles; he immediately recognized it for a part of the treasure stolen from Harry Hartley by the loiterer.
There was no room for mistake; it was exactly as the detective had described it; there were the ruby stars, with a great emerald in the centre; there were the interlacing crescents; and there were the pear-shaped pendants, each a single stone, which gave a special value to Lady Vandeleur's tiara. Mr. Rolles was hugely relieved. The Dictator was as deeply in the affair as he was; neither could tell tales upon the other. In the first glow of happiness, the clergyman suffered a deep sigh to escape him; and as his bosom had become choked and his throat dry during his previous suspense, the sigh was followed by a cough.
Mr. Vandeleur looked up; his face contracted with the blackest and most deadly passion; his eyes opened widely, and his under jaw dropped in an astonishment that was upon the brink of fury. By an instinctive movement he had covered the hat-box with the coat. For half a minute the two men stared upon each other in silence. It was not a long interval, but it sufficed for Mr. Rolles; he was one of those who think swiftly on dangerous occasions; he decided on a course of action of a singularly daring nature; and although he felt he was setting his life upon the hazard, he was the first to break silence. "I beg your pardon," said he.
The Dictator shivered slightly, and when he spoke his voice was hoarse. "What do you want here?" he asked. "I take a particular interest in diamonds," replied Mr. Rolles, with an air of perfect self-possession.
"Two connoisseurs should be acquainted. I have here a trifle of my own which may perhaps serve for an introduction." And so saying, he quietly took the case from his pocket, showed the Rajah's Diamond to the Dictator for an instant, and replaced it in security. "It was once your brother's," he added.
John Vandeleur continued to regard him with a look of almost painful amazement; but he neither spoke nor moved. "I was pleased to observe," resumed the young man, "that we have gems from the same collection." The Dictator's surprise overpowered him. "I beg your pardon," he said; "I begin to perceive that I am growing old!
I am positively not prepared for little incidents like this. But set my mind at rest upon one point: do my eyes deceive me, or are you indeed a parson?"
"I am in holy orders," answered Mr. Rolles.
"Well," cried the other, "as long as I live I will never hear another word against the cloth!" "You flatter me," said Mr. Rolles. "Pardon me," replied Vandeleur; "pardon me, young man.
You are no coward, but it still remains to be seen whether you are not the worst of fools. Perhaps," he continued, leaning back upon his seat, "perhaps you would oblige me with a few particulars. I must suppose you had some object in the stupefying impudence of your proceedings, and I confess I have a curiosity to know it." "It is very simple," replied the clergyman; "it proceeds from my great inexperience of life.
" "I shall be glad to be persuaded," answered Vandeleur. Whereupon Mr. Rolles told him the whole story of his connection with the Rajah's Diamond, from the time he found it in Raeburn's garden to the time when he left London in the Flying Scotchman. He added a brief sketch of his feelings and thoughts during the journey, and concluded in these words:  "When I recognized the tiara I knew we were in the same attitude toward Society, and this inspired me with a hope, which I trust you will say was not ill-founded, that you might become in some sense my partner in the difficulties and, of course, the profits of my situation.
To one of your special knowledge and obviously great experience the negotiation of the diamond would give but little trouble, while to me it was a matter of impossibility. On the other part, I judged that I might lose nearly as much by cutting the diamond, and that not improbably with an unskilful hand, as might enable me to pay you with proper generosity for your assistance. The subject was a delicate one to broach; and perhaps I fell short in delicacy. But I must ask you to remember that for me the situation was a new one, and I was entirely unacquainted with the etiquette in use.
I believe without vanity that I could have married or baptized you in a very acceptable manner; but every man has his own aptitudes, and this sort of bargain was not among the list of my accomplishments." "I do not wish to flatter you," replied Vandeleur; "but, upon my word, you have an unusual disposition for a life of crime. You have more accomplishments than you imagine; and though I have encountered a number of rogues in different quarters of the world, I never met with one so unblushing as yourself.
Cheer up, Mr. Rolles, you are in the right profession at last! As for helping you, you may command me as you will. I have only a day's business in Edinburgh on a little matter for my brother; and once that is concluded, I return to Paris, where I usually reside.
If you please you may accompany me thither. And before the end of a month I believe I shall have brought your little business to a satisfactory conclusion. " [At this point, contrary to all the canons of his art, our Arabian Author breaks off the "Story of the Young Man in Holy Orders.
" I regret and condemn such practises; but I must follow my original, and refer the reader for the conclusion of Mr. Rolles's adventures to the next number of the cycle, the "Story of the House with the Green Blinds."]    STORY OF THE HOUSE WITH THE GREEN BLINDS Francis Scrymgeour, a clerk in the Bank of Scotland at Edinburgh, had attained the age of twenty-five in a sphere of quiet, creditable, and domestic life. His mother died while he was young; but his father, a man of sense and probity, had given him an excellent education at school, and brought him up at home to orderly and frugal habits. Francis, who was of a docile and affectionate disposition, profited by these advantages with zeal, and devoted himself heart and soul to his employment. A walk upon Saturday afternoon, an occasional dinner with members of his family, and a yearly tour of a fortnight in the Highlands or even on the continent of Europe, were his principal distractions, and he grew rapidly in favor with his superiors, and enjoyed already a salary of nearly two hundred pounds a year, with the prospect of an ultimate advance to almost double that amount.
Few young men were more contented, few more willing and laborious, than Francis Scrymgeour. Sometimes at night, when he had read the daily paper, he would play upon the flute to amuse his father, for whose qualities he entertained a great respect. One day he received a note from a well-known firm of Writers to the Signet, requesting the favor of an immediate interview with him.
The letter was marked "Private and Confidential," and had been addressed to him at the bank, instead of at home two unusual circumstances which made him obey the summons with the more alacrity. The senior member of the firm, a man of much austerity of manner, made him gravely welcome, requested him to take a seat, and proceeded to explain the matter in hand in the picked expressions of a veteran man of business. A person, who must remain nameless, but of whom the lawyer had every reason to think well a man, in short, of some station in the country desired to make Francis an annual allowance of five hundred pounds.
The capital was to be placed under the control of the lawyer's firm and two trustees who must also remain anonymous. There were conditions annexed to this liberality, but he was of opinion that his new client would find nothing either excessive or dishonorable in the terms; and he repeated these two words with emphasis, as though he desired to commit himself to nothing more. Francis asked their nature. "The conditions," said the Writer to the Signet, "are, as I have twice remarked, neither dishonorable nor excessive.
At the same time I can not conceal from you that they are most unusual. Indeed, the whole case is very much out of our way; and I should certainly have refused it had it not been for the reputation of the gentleman who entrusted it to my care, and, let me add, Mr. Scrymgeour, the interest I have been led to take in yourself by many complimentary and, I have no doubt, well-deserved reports. " Francis entreated him to be more specific. "You can not picture my uneasiness as to these conditions," he said. "They are two," replied the lawyer, "only two; and the sum, as you will remember, is five hundred a year and unburdened, I forgot to add, unburdened."
And the lawyer raised his eyebrows at him with solemn gusto. "The first," he resumed, "is of remarkable simplicity. You must be in Paris by the afternoon of Sunday, the 15th; there you will find, at the box-office of the Comedie Française, a ticket for admission taken in your name and waiting you. You are requested to sit out the whole performance in the seat provided, and that is all."
"I should certainly have preferred a week-day," replied Francis.
"But, after all, once in a way "  "And in Paris, my dear sir," added the lawyer, soothingly. "I believe I am something of a precisian myself, but upon such a consideration, and in Paris, I should not hesitate an instant." And the pair laughed pleasantly together. "The other is of more importance," continued the Writer to the Signet.
"It regards your marriage. My client, taking a deep interest in your welfare, desires to advise you absolutely in the choice of a wife. Absolutely, you understand," he repeated. "Let us be more explicit, if you please," returned Francis. "Am I to marry any one, maid or widow, black or white, whom this invisible person chooses to propose?"
"I was to assure you that suitability of age and position should be a principle with your benefactor," replied the lawyer.
"As to race, I confess the difficulty had not occurred to me, and I failed to inquire; but if you like I will make a note of it at once, and advise you on the earliest opportunity." "Sir," said Francis, "it remains to be seen whether this whole affair is not a most unworthy fraud. The circumstances are inexplicable I had almost said incredible; and until I see a little more daylight, and some plausible motive, I confess I should be very sorry to put a hand to the transaction.
I appeal to you in this difficulty for information. I must learn what is at the bottom of it all. If you do not know, can not guess, or are not at liberty to tell me, I shall take my hat and go back to my bank as I came."
"I do not know," answered the lawyer, "but I have an excellent guess. Your father, and no one else, is at the root of this apparently unnatural business." "My father!" cried Francis, in extreme disdain. "Worthy man, I know every thought of his mind, every penny of his fortune!"
"You misinterpret my words," said the lawyer. "I do not refer to Mr. Scrymgeour, senior; for he is not your father. When he and his wife came to Edinburgh, you were already nearly one year old, and you had not yet been three months in their care.
The secret has been well kept; but such is the fact. Your father is unknown, and I say again that I believe him to be the original of the offers I am charged at present to transmit to you." It would be impossible to exaggerate the astonishment of Francis Scrymgeour at this unexpected information. He pleaded this confusion to the lawyer. "Sir," said he, "after a piece of news so startling, you must grant me some hours for thought.
You shall know this evening what conclusion I have reached. " The lawyer commended his prudence; and Francis, excusing himself upon some pretext at the bank, took a long walk into the country, and fully considered the different steps and aspects of the case. A pleasant sense of his own importance rendered him the more deliberate: but the issue was from the first not doubtful.
His whole carnal man leaned irresistibly toward the five hundred a year, and the strange conditions with which it was burdened; he discovered in his heart an invincible repugnance to the name of Scrymgeour, which he had never hitherto disliked; he began to despise the narrow and unromantic interests of his former life; and when once his mind was fairly made up, he walked with a new feeling of strength and freedom, and nourished himself with the gayest anticipations. He said but a word to the lawyer, and immediately received a check for two quarters' arrears; for the allowance was antedated from the first of January. With this in his pocket, he walked home. The flat in Scotland Street looked mean in his eyes; his nostrils, for the first time, rebelled against the odor of broth; and he observed little defects of manner in his adoptive father which filled him with surprise and almost with disgust.
The next day, he determined, should see him on his way to Paris. In that city, where he arrived long before the appointed date, he put up at a modest hotel frequented by English and Italians, and devoted himself to improvement in the French tongue; for this purpose he had a master twice a week, entered into conversation with loiterers in the Champs Elysées, and nightly frequented the theatre. He had his whole toilet fashionably renewed; and was shaved and had his hair dressed every morning by a barber in a neighboring street.
This gave him something of a foreign air, and seemed to wipe off the reproach of his past years. At length, on the Saturday afternoon, he betook himself to the box-office of the theatre in the Rue Richelieu. No sooner had he mentioned his name than the clerk produced the order in an envelope of which the address was scarcely dry.
"It has been taken this moment," said the clerk. "Indeed!" said Francis. "May I ask what the gentleman was like?"  "Your friend is easy to describe," replied the official. "He is old and strong and beautiful, with white hair and a sabre-cut across his face.
You can not fail to recognize so marked a person. " "No, indeed," returned Francis; "and I thank you for your politeness. " "He can not yet be far distant," added the clerk. "If you make haste you might still overtake him.
" Francis did not wait to be twice told; he ran precipitately from the theatre into the middle of the street and looked in all directions. More than one white-haired man was within sight; but though he overtook each of them in succession, all wanted the sabre-cut. For nearly half an hour he tried one street after another in the neighborhood, until at length, recognizing the folly of continued search, he started on a walk to compose his agitated feelings; for this proximity of an encounter with him to whom he could not doubt he owed the day had profoundly moved the young man. It chanced that his way lay up the Rue Drouot and thence up the Rue des Martyrs; and chance, in this case, served him better than all the forethought in the world. For on the outer boulevard he saw two men in earnest colloquy upon a seat.
One was dark, young, and handsome, secularly dressed, but with an indelible clerical stamp; the other answered in every particular to the description given him by the clerk. Francis felt his heart beat high in his bosom; he knew he was now about to hear the voice of his father; and making a wide circuit, he noiselessly took his place behind the couple in question, who were too much interested in their talk to observe much else. As Francis had expected, the conversation was conducted in the English language. "Your suspicions begin to annoy me, Rolles," said the older man. "I tell you I am doing my utmost; a man can not lay his hand on millions in a moment.
Have I not taken you up, a mere stranger, out of pure goodwill? Are you not living largely on my bounty?" "On your advances, Mr. Vandeleur," corrected the other. "Advances, if you choose; and interest instead of good-will, if you prefer it," returned Vandeleur, angrily.
"I am not here to pick expressions. Business is business; and your business, let me remind you, is too muddy for such airs. Trust me, or leave me alone and find some one else; but let us have an end, for God's sake, of your jeremiads."
"I am beginning to learn the world," replied the other, "and I see that you have every reason to play me false, and not one to deal honestly. I am not here to pick expressions, either; you wish the diamond for yourself; you know you do you dare not deny it.
Have you not already forged my name, and searched my lodging in my absence? I understand the cause of your delays; you are lying in wait; you are the diamond-hunter, forsooth; and sooner or later, by fair means or foul, you'll lay your hands upon it. I tell you, it must stop; push me much further and I promise you a surprise."
"It does not become you to use threats," returned Vandeleur. "Two can play at that. My brother is here in Paris; the police are on the alert; and if you persist in wearying me with your caterwauling, I will arrange a little astonishment for you, Mr. Rolles. But mine shall be once and for all.
Do you understand, or would you prefer me to tell it you in Hebrew? There is an end to all things, and you have come to the end of my patience. Tuesday, at seven; not a day, not an hour sooner, not the least part of a second, if it were to save your life. And if you do not choose to wait, you may go to the bottomless pit for me, and welcome." And so saying, the Dictator arose from the bench, and marched off in the direction of Montmartre, shaking his head and swinging his cane with a most furious air; while his companion remained where he was, in an attitude of great dejection.
Francis was at the pitch of surprise and horror; his sentiments had been shocked to the last degree; the hopeful tenderness with which he had taken his place upon the bench was transformed into repulsion and despair; old Mr. Scrymgeour, he reflected, was a far more kindly and creditable parent than this dangerous and violent intriguer; but he retained his presence of mind, and suffered not a moment to elapse before he was on the trail of the Dictator. That gentleman's fury carried him forward at a brisk pace, and he was so completely occupied in his angry thoughts that he never so much as cast a look behind him till he reached his own door. His house stood high up in the Rue Lepic, commanding a view of all Paris and enjoying the pure air of the heights. It was two stories high, with green blinds and shutters; and all the windows looking on the street were hermetically closed. Tops of trees showed over the high garden wall, and the wall was protected by chevaux-de-frise.
The Dictator paused a moment while he searched his pocket for a key; and then, opening a gate, disappeared within the enclosure. Francis looked about him; the neighborhood was very lonely; the house isolated in its garden. It seemed as if his observation must here come to an abrupt end.
A second glance, however, showed him a tall house next door presenting a gable to the garden, and in this gable a single window. He passed to the front and saw a ticket offering unfurnished lodgings by the month; and, on inquiry, the room which commanded the Dictator's garden proved to be one of those to let. Francis did not hesitate a moment; he took the room, paid an advance upon the rent, and returned to his hotel to seek his baggage.
The old man with the sabre-cut might or might not be his father; he might or he might not be upon the true scent; but he was certainly on the edge of an exciting mystery, and he promised himself that he would not relax his observation until he had got to the bottom of the secret. From the window of his new apartment Francis Scrymgeour commanded a complete view into the garden of the house with the green blinds. Immediately below him a very comely chestnut with wide boughs sheltered a pair of rustic tables where people might dine in the height of summer. On all sides save one a dense vegetation concealed the soil; but there, between the tables and the house, he saw a patch of gravel walk leading from the veranda to the garden gate.
Studying the place from between the boards of the Venetian shutters, which he durst not open for fear of attracting attention, Francis observed but little to indicate the manners of the inhabitants, and that little argued no more than a close reserve and a taste for solitude. The garden was conventual, the house had the air of a prison. The green blinds were all drawn down upon the outside; the door into the veranda was closed; the garden, as far as he could see it, was left entirely to itself in the evening sunshine.
A modest curl of smoke from a single chimney alone testified to the presence of living people. In order that he might not be entirely idle, and to give a certain color to his way of life, Francis had purchased Euclid's Geometry in French, which he set himself to copy and translate on the top of his portmanteau and seated on the floor against the wall; for he was equally without chair or table. From time to time he would rise and cast a glance into the enclosure of the house with the green blinds; but the windows remained obstinately closed and the garden empty.
Only late in the evening did anything occur to reward his continued attention. Between nine and ten the sharp tinkle of a bell aroused him from a fit of dozing; and he sprang to his observatory in time to hear an important noise of locks being opened and bars removed, and to see Mr. Vandeleur, carrying a lantern and clothed in a flowing robe of black velvet with a skull-cap to match, issue from under the veranda and proceed leisurely toward the garden gate. The sound of bolts and bars was then repeated; and a moment after Francis perceived the Dictator escorting into the house, in the mobile light of the lantern, an individual of the lowest and most despicable appearance. Half an hour afterward the visitor was reconducted to the street; and Mr. Vandeleur, setting his light upon one of the rustic tables, finished a cigar with great deliberation under the foliage of the chestnut. Francis, peering through a clear space among the leaves, was able to follow his gestures as he threw away the ash or enjoyed a copious inhalation; and beheld a cloud upon the old man's brow and a forcible action of the lips which testified to some deep and probably painful train of thought.
The cigar was already almost at an end, when the voice of a young girl was heard suddenly crying the hour from the interior of the house. "In a moment," replied John Vandeleur. And, with that, he threw away the stump and, taking up the lantern, sailed away under the veranda for the night.
As soon as the door was closed, absolute darkness fell upon the house. Francis might try his eyesight as much as he pleased, he could not detect so much as a single chink of light below a blind; and he concluded, with great good sense, that the bedchambers were all upon the other side. Early the next morning (for he was early awake after an uncomfortable night upon the floor), he saw cause to adopt a different explanation.
The blinds rose, one after another, by means of a spring in the interior, and disclosed steel shutters such as we see on the front of shops; these in their turn were rolled up by a similar contrivance; and, for the space of about an hour, the chambers were left open to the morning air. At the end of that time Mr. Vandeleur, with his own hand, once more closed the shutters and replaced the blinds from within. While Francis was still marveling at these precautions, the door opened and a young girl came forth to look about her in the garden. It was not two minutes before she reentered the house, but even in that short time he saw enough to convince him that she possessed the most unusual attractions.
His curiosity was not only highly excited by this incident, but his spirits were improved to a still more notable degree. The alarming manners and more than equivocal life of his father ceased from that moment to prey upon his mind; from that moment he embraced his new family with ardor; and whether the young lady should prove his sister or his wife, he felt convinced she was an angel in disguise. So much was this the case that he was seized with a sudden horror when he reflected how little he really knew, and how possible it was that he had followed the wrong person when he followed Mr. Vandeleur. The porter, whom he consulted, could afford him little information; but, such as it was, it had a mysterious and questionable sound.
The person next door was an English gentleman of extraordinary wealth, and proportionately eccentric in his tastes and habits. He possessed great collections, which he kept in the house beside him; and it was to protect these that he had fitted the place with steel shutters, elaborate fastenings, and chevaux-de-frise along the garden wall. He lived much alone, in spite of some strange visitors with whom, it seemed, he had business to transact; and there was no one else in the house, except Mademoiselle and an old woman servant.
"Is Mademoiselle his daughter?" inquired Francis. "Certainly," replied the porter. "Mademoiselle is the daughter of the house; and strange it is to see how she is made to work.
For all his riches, it is she who goes to market; and every day in the week you may see her going by with a basket on her arm." "And the collections?" asked the other. "Sir," said the man, "they are immensely valuable.
More I can not tell you. Since M. de Vandeleur's arrival no one in the quarter has so much as passed the door." "Suppose not," returned Francis, "you must surely have some notion what these famous galleries contain. Is it pictures, silks, statues, jewels, or what?"
"My faith, sir," said the fellow with a shrug, "it might be carrots, and still I could not tell you. How should I know?
The house is kept like a garrison, as you perceive. " And then as Francis was returning disappointed to his room, the porter called him back. "I have just remembered, sir," said he. "M. de Vandeleur has been in all parts of the world, and I once heard the old woman declare that he had brought many diamonds back with him.
If that be the truth, there must be a fine show behind those shutters." By an early hour on Sunday Francis was in his place at the theatre. The seat which had been taken for him was only two or three numbers from the left-hand side, and directly opposite one of the lower boxes. As the seat had been specially chosen there was doubtless something to be learned from its position; and he judged by an instinct that the box upon his right was, in some way or other, to be connected with the drama in which he ignorantly played a part. Indeed it was so situated that its occupants could safely observe him from beginning to end of the piece, if they were so minded; while, profiting by the depth, they could screen themselves sufficiently well from any counter-examination on his side.
He promised himself not to leave it for a moment out of sight; and while he scanned the rest of the theatre, or made a show of attending to the business of the stage, he always kept a corner of an eye upon the empty box. The second act had been some time in progress, and was even drawing toward a close, when the door opened and two persons entered and ensconced themselves in the darkest of the shade. Francis could hardly control his emotion. It was Mr. Vandeleur and his daughter. The blood came and went in his arteries and veins with stunning activity; his ears sang; his head turned.
He dared not look lest he should awake suspicion; his play-bill, which he kept reading from end to end and over and over again, turned from white to red before his eyes; and when he cast a glance upon the stage, it seemed incalculably far away, and he found the voices and gestures of the actors to the last degree impertinent and absurd. From time to time he risked a momentary look in the direction which principally interested him; and once at least he felt certain that his eyes encountered those of the young girl. A shock passed over his body, and he saw all the colors of the rainbow.
What would he not have given to overhear what passed between the Vandeleurs?
What would he not have given for the courage to take up his opera-glass and steadily inspect their attitude and expression? There, for aught he knew, his whole life was being decided and he not able to interfere, not able even to follow the debate, but condemned to sit and suffer where he was, in impotent anxiety. At last the act came to an end. The curtain fell, and the people around him began to leave their places for the interval.
It was only natural that he should follow their example; and if he did so, it was not only natural but necessary that he should pass immediately in front of the box in question. Summoning all his courage, but keeping his eyes lowered, Francis drew near the spot. His progress was slow, for the old gentleman before him moved with incredible deliberation, wheezing as he went. What was he to do?
Should he address the Vandeleurs by name as he went by?
Should he take the flower from his buttonhole and throw it into the box? Should he raise his face and direct one long and affectionate look upon the lady who was either his sister or his betrothed?
As he found himself thus struggling among so many alternatives, he had a vision of his old equable existence in the bank, and was assailed by a thought of regret for the past. By this time he had arrived directly opposite the box; and although he was still undetermined what to do or whether to do anything, he turned his head and lifted his eyes. No sooner had he done so than he uttered a cry of disappointment and remained rooted to the spot.
The box was empty. During his slow advance Mr. Vandeleur and his daughter had quietly slipped away. A polite person in his rear reminded him that he was stopping the path; and he moved on again with mechanical footsteps, and suffered the crowd to carry him unresisting out of the theatre.
Once in the street, the pressure ceasing, he came to a halt, and the cool night air speedily restored him to the possession of his faculties. He was surprised to find that his head ached violently, and that he remembered not one word of the two acts which he had witnessed. As the excitement wore away, it was succeeded by an over-weening appetite for sleep, and he hailed a cab and drove to his lodging in a state of extreme exhaustion and some disgust of life. Next morning he lay in wait for Miss Vandeleur on her road to market, and by eight o'clock beheld her stepping down a lane.
She was simply, and even poorly, attired; but in the carriage of her head and body there was something flexible and noble that would have lent distinction to the meanest toilet. Even her basket, so aptly did she carry it, became her like an ornament. It seemed to Francis, as he slipped into a doorway, that the sunshine followed and the shadows fled before her as she walked; and he was conscious, for the first time, of a bird singing in a cage above the lane. He suffered her to pass the doorway, and then, coming forth once more, addressed her by name from behind.
"Miss Vandeleur," said he. She turned, and, when she saw who he was, became deadly pale. "Pardon me," he continued; "Heaven knows I had no will to startle you; and, indeed, there should be nothing startling in the presence of one who wishes you so well as I do. And, believe me, I am acting rather from necessity than choice.
We have many things in common, and I am sadly in the dark. There is much that I should be doing, and my hands are tied. I do not know even what to feel, nor who are my friends and enemies.
" She found her voice with an effort. "I do not know who you are," she said. "Ah, yes!  Miss Vandeleur, you do," returned Francis; "better than I do myself.
Indeed it is on that, above all, that I seek light. Tell me what you know," he pleaded. "Tell me who I am, who you are, and how our destinies are intermixed. Give me a little help with my life, Miss Vandeleur only a word or two to guide me, only the name of my father, if you will and I shall be grateful and content."
"I will not attempt to deceive you," she replied. "I know who you are, but I am not at liberty to say."  "Tell me, at least, that you have forgiven my presumption, and I shall wait with all the patience I have," he said.
"If I am not to know, I must do without. It is cruel, but I can bear more upon a push. Only do not add to my troubles the thought that I have made an enemy of you."
"You did only what was natural," she said, "and I have nothing to forgive you. Farewell."
"Is it to be farewell?"
he asked. "Nay, that I do not know myself," she answered. "Farewell for the present, if you like."
And with these words she was gone. Francis returned to his lodging in a state of considerable commotion of mind. He made the most trifling progress with his Euclid for that forenoon, and was more often at the window than at his improvised writing-table.
But beyond seeing the return of Miss Vandeleur, and the meeting between her and her father, who was smoking a Trichinopoli cigar in the veranda, there was nothing notable in the neighborhood of the house with the green blinds before the time of the midday meal.
The young man hastily allayed his appetite in a neighboring restaurant, and returned with the speed of unallayed curiosity to the house in the Rue Lepic. A mounted servant was leading a saddle-horse to and fro before the garden wall; and the porter of Francis's lodging was smoking a pipe against the door-post, absorbed in contemplation of the livery and the steeds. "Look!" he cried to the young man, "what fine cattle! what an elegant costume!
They belong to the brother of M. de Vandeleur, who is now within upon a visit. He is a great man, a general, in your country; and you doubtless know him well by reputation." "I confess," returned Francis, "that I have never heard of General Vandeleur before.
We have many officers of that grade, and my pursuits have been exclusively civil." "It is he," replied the porter, "who lost the great diamond of the Indies. Of that at least you must have read often in the papers." As soon as Francis could disengage himself from the porter he ran upstairs and hurried to the window.
Immediately below the clear space in the chestnut leaves, the two gentlemen were seated in conversation over a cigar. The General, a red, military-looking man, offered some traces of a family resemblance to his brother; he had something of the same features, something, although very little, of the same free and powerful carriage; but he was older, smaller, and more common in air; his likeness was that of a caricature, and he seemed altogether a poor and debile being by the side of the Dictator. They spoke in tones so low, leaning over the table with every appearance of interest, that Francis could catch no more than a word or two on an occasion. For as little as he heard, he was convinced that the conversation turned upon himself and his own career; several times the name of Scrymgeour reached his ear, for it was easy to distinguish, and still more frequently he fancied he could distinguish the name Francis. At length the General, as if in a hot anger, broke forth into several violent exclamations.
"Francis Vandeleur!" he cried, accentuating the last word. "Francis Vandeleur, I tell you." The Dictator made a movement of his whole body, half affirmative, half contemptuous, but his answer was inaudible to the young man. Was he the Francis Vandeleur in question?
he wondered. Were they discussing the name under which he was to be married? Or was the whole affair a dream and a delusion of his own conceit and self-absorption? After another interval of inaudible talk, dissension seemed again to arise between the couple underneath the chestnut, and again the General raised his voice angrily so as to be audible to Francis.
"My wife?" he cried. "I have done with my wife for good. I will not hear her name. I am sick of her very name.
" And he swore aloud and beat the table with his fist. The Dictator appeared, by his gestures, to pacify him after a paternal fashion; and a little after he conducted him to the garden gate. The pair shook hands affectionately enough; but as soon as the door had closed behind his visitor, John Vandeleur fell into a fit of laughter which sounded unkindly and even devilish in the ears of Francis Scrymgeour. So another day had passed, and little more learned.
But the young man remembered that the morrow was Tuesday, and promised himself some curious discoveries; all might be well, or all might be ill; he was sure, at least, to glean some curious information, and, perhaps, by good luck, get at the heart of the mystery which surrounded his father and his family.
As the hour of the dinner drew near many preparations were made in the garden of the house with the green blinds. That table which was partly visible to Francis through the chestnut leaves was destined to serve as a sideboard, and carried relays of plates and the materials for salad; the other, which was almost entirely concealed, had been set apart for the diners, and Francis could catch glimpses of white cloth and silver plate. Mr. Rolles arrived, punctual to the minute; he looked like a man upon his guard, and spoke low and sparingly. The Dictator, on the other hand, appeared to enjoy an unusual flow of spirits; his laugh, which was youthful and pleasant to hear, sounded frequently from the garden; by the modulation and the changes of his voice it was obvious that he told many droll stories and imitated the accents of a variety of different nations; and before he and the young clergyman had finished their vermuth all feeling of distrust was at an end, and they were talking together like a pair of school companions.
At length Miss Vandeleur made her appearance, carrying the soup-tureen. Mr. Rolles ran to offer her assistance which she laughingly refused; and there was an interchange of pleasantries among the trio which seemed to have reference to this primitive manner of waiting by one of the company. "One is more at one's ease," Mr. Vandeleur was heard to declare.
Next moment they were all three in their places, and Francis could see as little as he could hear of what passed. But the dinner seemed to go merrily; there was a perpetual babble of voices and sound of knives and forks below the chestnut; and Francis, who had no more than a roll to gnaw, was affected with envy by the comfort and deliberation of the meal.
The party lingered over one dish after another, and then over a delicate dessert, with a bottle of old wine carefully uncorked by the hand of the Dictator himself. As it began to grow dark a lamp was set upon the table and a couple of candles on the sideboard; for the night was perfectly pure, starry, and windless. Light overflowed besides from the door and window in the veranda, so that the garden was fairly illuminated and the leaves twinkled in the darkness. For perhaps the tenth time Miss Vandeleur entered the house; and on this occasion she returned with the coffee-tray, which she placed upon the sideboard.
At the same moment her father rose from his seat. "The coffee is my province," Francis heard him say. And next moment he saw his supposed father standing by the sideboard in the light of the candles. Talking over his shoulder all the while, Mr. Vandeleur poured out two cups of the brown stimulant, and then, by a rapid act of prestidigitation, emptied the contents of a tiny phial into the smaller of the two.
The thing was so swiftly done that even Francis, who looked straight into his face, had hardly time to perceive the movement before it was completed. And next instant, and still laughing, Mr. Vandeleur had turned again toward the table with a cup in either hand. "Ere we have done with this," said he, "we may expect our famous Hebrew. " It would be impossible to depict the confusion and distress of Francis Scrymgeour.
He saw foul play going forward before his eyes, and he felt bound to interfere, but knew not how. It might be a mere pleasantry, and then how should he look if he were to offer an unnecessary warning?
Or again, if it were serious, the criminal might be his own father, and then how should he not lament if he were to bring ruin on the author of his days? For the first time he became conscious of his own position as a spy.
To wait inactive at such a juncture and with such a conflict of sentiments in his bosom was to suffer the most acute torture; he clung to the bars of the shutters, his heart beat fast and with irregularity, and he felt a strong sweat break forth upon his body. Several minutes passed. He seemed to perceive the conversation die away and grow less and less in vivacity and volume; but still no sign of any alarming or even notable event. Suddenly the ring of a glass breaking was followed by a faint and dull sound, as of a person who should have fallen forward with his head upon the table.
At the same moment a piercing scream rose from the garden. "What have you done?" cried Miss Vandeleur. "He is dead!"
The Dictator replied in a violent whisper, so strong and sibilant that every word was audible to the watcher at the window.
"Silence!" said Mr. Vandeleur; "the man is as well as I am. Take him by the heels while I carry him by the shoulders. " Francis heard Miss Vandeleur break forth into a passion of tears.
"Do you hear what I say?" resumed the Dictator, in the same tones. "Or do you wish to quarrel with me? I give you your choice, Miss Vandeleur."
There was another pause, and the Dictator spoke again. "Take that man by the heels," he said. "I must have him brought into the house. If I were a little younger, I could help myself against the world. But now that years and dangers are upon me and my hands are weakened, I must turn to you for aid.
" "It is a crime," replied the girl. "I am your father," said Mr. Vandeleur. This appeal seemed to produce its effect.
A scuffling noise followed upon the gravel, a chair was overset, and then Francis saw the father and daughter stagger across the walk and disappear under the veranda, bearing the inanimate body of Mr. Rolles embraced about the knees and shoulders. The young clergyman was limp and pallid, and his head rolled upon his shoulders at every step. Was he alive or dead? Francis, in spite of the Dictator's declaration, inclined to the latter view. A great crime had been committed; a great calamity had fallen upon the inhabitants of the house with the green blinds.
To his surprise, Francis found all horror for the deed swallowed up in sorrow for a girl and an old man whom he judged to be in the height of peril. A tide of generous feeling swept into his heart; he, too, would help his father against man and mankind, against fate and justice; and casting open the shutters he closed his eyes and threw himself with outstretched arms into the foliage of the chestnut. Branch after branch slipped from his grasp or broke under his weight; then he caught a stalwart bough under his armpit, and hung suspended for a second; and then he let himself drop and fell heavily against the table.
A cry of alarm from the house warned him that his entrance had not been effected unobserved. He recovered himself with a stagger, and in three bounds crossed the intervening space and stood before the door in the veranda. In a small apartment, carpeted with matting and surrounded by glazed cabinets full of rare and costly curios, Mr. Vandeleur was stooping over the body of Mr. Rolles.
He raised himself as Francis entered, and there was an instantaneous passage of hands. It was the business of a second; as fast as an eye can wink the thing was done; the young man had not the time to be sure, but it seemed to him as if the Dictator had taken something from the curate's breast, looked at it for the least fraction of time as it lay in his hand, and then suddenly and swiftly passed it to his daughter. All this was over while Francis had still one foot upon the threshold, and the other raised in air.
The next instant he was on his knees to Mr. Vandeleur. "Father!"
he cried. "Let me too help you. I will do what you wish and ask no questions; I will obey you with my life; treat me as a son, and you will find I have a son's demotion.
" A deplorable explosion of oaths was the Dictator's first reply. "Son and father?" he cried. "Father and son?
What dd unnatural comedy is all this?
How do you come in my garden? What do you want?
And who, in God's name, are you?"  Francis, with a stunned and shamefaced aspect, got upon his feet again, and stood in silence. Then a light seemed to break upon Mr. Vandeleur, and he laughed aloud. "I see," cried he.
"It is the Scrymgeour. Very well, Mr. Scrymgeour.
Let me tell you in a few words how you stand. You have entered my private residence by force, or perhaps by fraud, but certainly with no encouragement from me; and you come at a moment of some annoyance, a guest having fainted at my table, to besiege me with your protestations. You are no son of mine.
You are my brother's bastard by a fishwife, if you want to know. I regard you with an indifference closely bordering on aversion; and from what I now see of your conduct, I judge your mind to be exactly suitable to your exterior. I recommend you these mortifying reflections for your leisure; and, in the meantime, let me beseech you to rid us of your presence. If I were not occupied," added the Dictator, with a terrifying oath, "I should give you the unholiest drubbing ere you went!" Francis listened in profound humiliation.
He would have fled had it been possible; but as he had no means of leaving the residence into which he had so unfortunately penetrated, he could do no more than stand foolishly where he was. It was Miss Vandeleur who broke the silence. "Father," she said, "you speak in anger.
Mr. Scrymgeour may have been mistaken, but he meant well and kindly. " "Thank you for speaking," returned the Dictator. "You remind me of some other observations which I hold it a point of honor to make to Mr. Scrymgeour. My brother," he continued, addressing the young man, "has been foolish enough to give you an allowance; he was foolish enough and presumptuous enough to propose a match between you and this young lady.
You were exhibited to her two nights ago; and I rejoice to tell you that she rejected the idea with disgust. Let me add that I have considerable influence with your father; and it shall not be my fault if you are not beggared of your allowance and sent back to your scrivening ere the week be out. " The tones of the old man's voice were, if possible, more wounding than his language; Francis felt himself exposed to the most cruel, blighting, and unbearable contempt; his head turned, and he covered his face with his hands, uttering at the same time a tearless sob of agony. But Miss Vandeleur once again interfered in his behalf.
"Mr. Scrymgeour," she said, speaking in clear and even tones, "you must not be concerned at my father's harsh expressions. I felt no disgust for you; on the contrary, I asked an opportunity to make your better acquaintance. As for what has passed to-night, believe me, it has filled my mind with both pity and esteem." Just then Mr. Rolles made a convulsive movement with his arm, which convinced Francis that he was only drugged, and was beginning to throw off the influence of the opiate. Mr. Vandeleur stooped over him and examined his face for an instant.
"Come, come!" cried he, raising his head. "Let there be an end of this. And since you are so pleased with his conduct, Miss Vandeleur, take a candle and show the bastard out."
The young lady hastened to obey. "Thank you," said Francis, as soon as he was alone with her in the garden. "I thank you from my soul. This has been the bitterest evening of my life, but it will have always one pleasant recollection.
" "I spoke as I felt," she replied, "and in justice to you. It made my heart sorry that you should be so unkindly used. " By this time they had reached the garden gate; and Miss Vandeleur, having set the candle on the ground, was already unfastening the bolts.
"One word more," said Francis. "This is not for the last time I shall see you again, shall I not?"  "Alas!"
she answered.
"You have heard my father. What can I do but obey?"  "Tell me at least that it is not with your consent," returned Francis; "tell me that you have no wish to see the last of me."
"Indeed," replied she, "I have none. You seem to me both brave and honest." "Then," said Francis, "give me a keepsake.
" She paused for a moment, with her hand upon the key; for the various bars and bolts were all undone, and there was nothing left but to open the lock. "If I agree," she said, "will you promise to do as I tell you from point to point?" "Can you ask?" replied Francis. "I would do so willingly on your bare word. " She turned the key and threw open the door.
"Be it so," said she. "You do not know what you ask, but be it so.
Whatever you hear," she continued, "whatever happens, do not return to this house; hurry fast until you reach the lighted and populous quarters of the city; even there be upon your guard. You are in a greater danger than you fancy.
Promise me you will not so much as look at my keepsake until you are in a place of safety. " "I promise," replied Francis. She put something loosely wrapped in a handkerchief into the young man's hand; and at the same time, with more strength than he could have anticipated, she pushed him into the street.
"Now, run!" she cried. He heard the door close behind him, and the noise of the bolts being replaced. "My faith," said he, "since I have promised!" And he took to his heels down the lane that leads into the Rue Ravignan.
He was not fifty paces from the house with the green blinds when the most diabolical outcry suddenly arose out of the stillness of the night. Mechanically he stood still; another passenger followed his example; in the neighboring floors he saw people crowding to the windows; a conflagration could not have produced more disturbance in this empty quarter. And yet it seemed to be all the work of a single man, roaring between grief and rage, like a lioness robbed of her whelps; and Francis was surprised and alarmed to hear his own name shouted with English imprecations to the wind.
His first movement was to return to the house; his second, as he remembered Miss Vandeleur's advice, to continue his flight with greater expedition than before; and he was in the act of turning to put his thought in action, when the Dictator, bare-headed, bawling aloud, his white hair blowing about his head, shot past him like a ball out of the cannon's mouth, and went careering down the street. "That was a close shave," thought Francis to himself. "What he wants with me, and why he should be so disturbed, I can not think; but he is plainly not good company for the moment, and I can not do better than follow Miss Vandeleur's advice. " So saying, he turned to retrace his steps, thinking to double and descend by the Rue Lepic itself while his pursuer should continue to follow after him on the other line of street.
The plan was ill-devised: as a matter of fact, he should have taken his seat in the nearest café, and waited there until the first heat of the pursuit was over. But besides that Francis had no experience and little natural aptitude for the small war of private life, he was so unconscious of any evil on his part, that he saw nothing to fear beyond a disagreeable interview.
And to disagreeable interviews he felt he had already served his apprenticeship that evening; nor could he suppose that Miss Vandeleur had left anything unsaid. Indeed, the young man was sore both in body and mind the one was all bruised, the other was full of smarting arrows; and he owned to himself that Mr. Vandeleur was master of a very deadly tongue. The thought of his bruises reminded him that he had not only come without a hat, but that his clothes had considerably suffered in his descent through the chestnut.
At the first magazine he purchased a cheap wideawake, and had the disorder of his toilet summarily repaired. The keepsake, still rolled in the handkerchief, he thrust in the meanwhile into his trousers pocket. Not many steps beyond the shop he was conscious of a sudden shock, a hand upon his throat, an infuriated face close to his own, and an open mouth bawling curses in his ear. The Dictator, having found no trace of his quarry, was returning by the other way.
Francis was a stalwart young fellow, but he was no match for his adversary whether in strength or skill; and after a few ineffectual struggles he resigned himself entirely to his captor. "What do you want with me?" said he. "We will talk of that at home," returned the Dictator, grimly.
And he continued to march the young man up hill in the direction of the house with the green blinds. But Francis, although he no longer struggled, was only waiting an opportunity to make a bold push for freedom.
With a sudden jerk he left the collar of his coat in the hands of Mr. Vandeleur, and once more made off at his best speed in the direction of the Boulevards. The tables were now turned. If the Dictator was the stronger, Francis, in the top of his youth, was the more fleet of foot, and he had soon effected his escape among the crowds. Relieved for a moment, but with a growing sentiment of alarm and wonder in his mind, he walked briskly until he debouched upon the Place de l'Opera, lit up like day with electric lamps.
"This, at least," thought he, "should satisfy Miss Vandeleur. " And turning to his right along the Boulevards, he entered the Café Americain and ordered some beer. It was both late and early for the majority of the frequenters of the establishment.
Only two or three persons, all men, were dotted here and there at separate tables in the hall; and Francis was too much occupied by his own thoughts to observe their presence. He drew the handkerchief from his pocket. The object wrapped in it proved to be a morocco case, clasped and ornamented in gilt, which opened by means of a spring, and disclosed to the horrified young man a diamond of monstrous bigness and extraordinary brilliancy. The circumstance was so inexplicable, the value of the stone was plainly so enormous, that Francis sat staring into the open casket without movement, without conscious thought, like a man stricken suddenly with idiocy.
A hand was laid upon his shoulder, lightly but firmly, and a quiet voice, which yet had in it the ring of command, uttered these words in his ear:  "Close the casket, and compose your face."  Looking up, he beheld a man, still young, of an urbane and tranquil presence, and dressed with rich simplicity. This personage had risen from a neighboring table, and, bringing his glass with him, had taken a seat beside Francis. "Close the casket," repeated the stranger, "and put it quietly back into your pocket, where I feel persuaded it should never have been. Try, if you please, to throw off your bewildered air, and act as thought I were one of your acquaintances whom you had met by chance.
So!
Touch glasses with me.
That is better. I fear, sir, you must be an amateur." And the stranger pronounced these last words with a smile of peculiar meaning, leaned back in his seat, and enjoyed a deep inhalation of tobacco. "For God's sake," said Francis, "tell me who you are and what this means?
Why I should obey your most unusual suggestions I am sure I know not; but the truth is, I have fallen this evening into so many perplexing adventures, and all I meet conduct themselves so strangely, that I think I must either have gone mad or wandered into another planet Your face inspires me with confidence; you seem wise, good, and experienced; tell me, for Heaven's sake, why you accost me in so odd a fashion?"
"All in due time," replied the stranger.
"But I have the first hand, and you must begin by telling me how the Rajah's Diamond is in your possession." "The Rajah's Diamond!" echoed Francis. "I would not speak so loud, if I were you," returned the other.
"But most certainly you have the Rajah's Diamond in your pocket. I have seen and handled it a score of times in Sir Thomas Vandeleur's collection." "Sir Thomas Vandeleur!
The General!
My father!" cried Francis. "Your father?" repeated the stranger. "I was not aware the General had any family." "I am illegitimate, sir," replied Francis, with a flush. The other bowed with gravity.
It was a respectful bow, as of a man silently apologizing to his equal; and Francis felt relieved and comforted, he scarce knew why. The society of this person did him good; he seemed to touch firm ground; a strong feeling of respect grew up in his bosom, and mechanically he removed his wideawake as though in the presence of a superior. "I perceive," said the stranger, "that your adventures have not all been peaceful. Your collar is torn, your face is scratched, you have a cut upon your temple; you will, perhaps, pardon my curiosity when I ask you to explain how you came by these injuries, and how you happen to have stolen property to an enormous value in your pocket.
" "I must differ from you!" returned Francis, hotly. "I possess no stolen property. And if you refer to the diamond, it was given to me not an hour ago by Miss Vandeleur in the Rue Lepic."
"By Miss Vandeleur of the Rue Lepic!" repeated the other. "You interest me more than you suppose. Pray continue." "Heavens!" cried Francis.
His memory had made a sudden bound. He had seen Mr. Vandeleur take an article from the breast of his drugged visitor, and that article, he was now persuaded, was a morocco case. "You have a light?" inquired the stranger. "Listen," replied Francis.
"I know not who you are, but I believe you to be worthy of confidence and helpful; I find myself in strange waters; I must have counsel and support, and since you invite me I shall tell you all." And he briefly recounted his experiences since the day when he was summoned from the bank by his lawyer. "Yours is indeed a remarkable history," said the stranger, after the young man had made an end of his narrative; "and your position is full of difficulty and peril. Many would counsel you to seek out your father, and give the diamond to him; but I have other views.
Waiter!" he cried. The waiter drew near. "Will you ask the manager to speak with me a moment?" said he; and Francis observed once more, both in his tone and manner, the evidence of a habit of command.
The waiter withdrew, and returned in a moment with the manager, who bowed with obsequious respect. "What," said he, "can I do to serve you?"  "Have the goodness," replied the stranger, indicating Francis, "to tell this gentleman my name. " "You have the honor, sir," said the functionary, addressing young Scrymgeour, "to occupy the same table with His Highness Prince Florizel of Bohemia."
Francis rose with precipitation, and made a grateful reverence to the Prince, who bade him resume his seat. "I thank you," said Florizel, once more addressing the functionary; "I am sorry to have deranged you for so small a matter." And he dismissed him with a movement of his hand. "And now," added the Prince, turning to Francis, "give me the diamond. " Without a word the casket was handed over.
"You have done right," said Florizel; "your sentiments have properly inspired you, and you will live to be grateful for the misfortunes of to-night. A man, Mr. Scrymgeour, may fall into a thousand perplexities, but if his heart be upright and his intelligence unclouded, he will issue from them all without dishonor. Let your mind be at rest; your affairs are in my hand; and with the aid of Heaven I am strong enough to bring them to a good end. Follow me, if you please, to my carriage.
" So saying, the Prince arose and, having left a piece of gold for the waiter, conducted the young man from the café and along the Boulevard to where an unpretentious brougham and a couple of servants out of livery awaited his arrival. "This carriage," said he, "is at your disposal; collect your baggage as rapidly as you can make it convenient, and my servants will conduct you to a villa in the neighborhood of Paris where you can wait in some degree of comfort until I have had time to arrange your situation. You will find there a pleasant garden, a library of good authors, a cook, a cellar, and some good cigars, which I recommend to your attention. Jerome," he added, turning to one of the servants, "you have heard what I say; I leave Mr. Scrymgeour in your charge; you will, I know, be careful of my friend. " Francis uttered some broken phrases of gratitude.
"It will be time enough to thank me," said the Prince, "when you are acknowledged by your father and married to Miss Vandeleur." And with that the Prince turned away and strolled leisurely in the direction of Montmarte. He hailed the first passing cab, gave an address, and a quarter of an hour afterward, having discharged the driver some distance lower, he was knocking at Mr. Vandeleur's garden-gate. It was opened with singular precautions by the Dictator in person.
"Who are you?" he demanded. "You must pardon me this late visit, Mr. Vandeleur," replied the Prince. "Your Highness is always welcome," returned Mr. Vandeleur, stepping back. The Prince profited by the open space, and without waiting for his host walked right into the house and opened the door of the salon.
Two people were seated there; one was Miss Vandeleur, who bore the marks of weeping about her eyes, and was still shaken from time to time by a sob; in the other the Prince recognized the young man who had consulted him on literary matters about a month before, in a club smoking-room. "Good-evening, Miss Vandeleur," said Florizel; "you look fatigued. Mr. Rolles, I believe?
I hope you have profited by the study of Gaboriau, Mr. Rolles." But the young clergyman's temper was too much embittered for speech; and he contented himself with bowing stiffly, and continued to gnaw his lip.
"To what good wind," said Mr. Vandeleur, following his guest, "am I to attribute the honor of your Highness's presence?" "I am come on business," returned the Prince; "on business with you; as soon as that is settled I shall request Mr. Rolles to accompany me for a walk. Mr. Rolles," he added, with severity, "let me remind you that I have not yet sat down."
The clergyman sprang to his feet with an apology; whereupon the Prince took an armchair beside the table, handed his hat to Mr. Vandeleur, his cane to Mr. Rolles, and, leaving them standing and thus menially employed upon his service, spoke as follows:  "I have come here, as I said, upon business; but, had I come looking for pleasure, I could not have been more displeased with my reception nor more dissatisfied with my company. You, sir," addressing Mr. Rolles, "you have treated your superior in station with discourtesy; you, Vandeleur, receive me with a smile, but you know right well that your hands are not yet cleansed from misconduct. I do not desire to be interrupted, sir," he added, imperiously; "I am here to speak, and not to listen; and I have to ask you to hear me with respect, and to obey punctiliously.
At the earliest possible date your daughter shall be married at the Embassy to my friend, Francis Scrymgeour, your brother's acknowledged son. You will oblige me by offering not less than ten thousand pounds dowry. For yourself, I will indicate to you in writing a mission of some importance in Siam which I destine to your care. And now, sir, you will answer me in two words whether or not you agree to these conditions. " "Your Highness will pardon me," said Mr. Vandeleur, "and permit me, with all respect, to submit to him two queries?"
"The permission is granted," replied the Prince. "Your Highness," resumed the Dictator, "has called Mr. Scrymgeour his friend. Believe me, had I known he was thus honored, I should have treated him with proportional respect. " "You interrogate adroitly," said the Prince; "but it will not serve your turn. You have my commands; if I had never seen that gentleman before to-night, it would not render them less absolute."
"Your Highness interprets my meaning with his usual subtlety," returned Vandeleur. "Once more: I have, unfortunately, put the police upon the track of Mr. Scrymgeour on a charge of theft; am I to withdraw or to uphold the accusation?"
"You will please yourself," replied Florizel. "The question is one between your conscience and the laws of this land.
Give me my hat; and you, Mr. Rolles, give me my cane and follow me. Miss Vandeleur, I wish you good-evening. I judge," he added to Vandeleur, "that your silence means unqualified assent." "If I can do no better," replied the old man, "I shall submit; but I warn you openly it shall not be without a struggle."
"You are old," said the Prince; "but years are disgraceful to the wicked. Your age is more unwise than the youth of others. Do not provoke me, or you may find me harder than you dream.
This is the first time that I have fallen across your path in anger; take care that it be the last." With these words, motioning the clergyman to follow, Florizel left the apartment and directed his steps toward the garden gate; and the Dictator, following with a candle, gave them light, and once more undid the elaborate fastenings with which he sought to protect himself from intrusion. "Your daughter is no longer present," said the Prince, turning on the threshold. "Let me tell you that I understand your threats; and you have only to lift your hand to bring upon yourself sudden and irremediable ruin." The Dictator made no reply; but as the Prince turned his back upon him in the lamplight he made a gesture full of menace and insane fury; and the next moment, slipping round a corner, he was running at full speed for the nearest cab-stand.
[Here, says my Arabian, the thread of events is finally diverted from "The House with the Green Blinds." One more adventure, he adds, and we have done with "The Rajah's Diamond." That last link in the chain is known among the inhabitants of Bagdad by the name of "The Adventure of Prince Florizel and a Detective."]    THE ADVENTURE OF PRINCE FLORIZEL AND A DETECTIVE  Prince Florizel walked with Mr. Rolles to the door of a small hotel where the latter resided. They spoke much together, and the clergyman was more than once affected to tears by the mingled severity and tenderness of Florizel's reproaches.
"I have made ruin of my life," he said at last. "Help me; tell me what I am to do; I have, alas! neither the virtues of a priest nor the dexterity of a rogue.
" "Now that you are humbled," said the Prince, "I command no longer; the repentant have to do with God and not with princes. But if you will let me advise you, go to Australia as a colonist, seek menial labor in the open air, and try to forget that you have ever been a clergyman, or that you ever set eyes on that accursed stone."
"Accursed, indeed!" replied Mr. Rolles.
"Where is it now? What further hurt is it not working for mankind?" "It will do no more evil," returned the Prince.
"It is here in my pocket. And this," he added, kindly, "will show that I place some faith in your penitence, young as it is." "Suffer me to touch your hand," pleaded Mr. Rolles. "No," replied Prince Florizel, "not yet.
" The tone in which he uttered these last words was eloquent in the ears of the young clergyman; and for some minutes after the Prince had turned away he stood on the threshold following with his eyes the retreating figure and invoking the blessing of Heaven upon a man so excellent in counsel. For several hours the Prince walked alone in unfrequented streets. His mind was full of concern; what to do with the diamond, whether to return it to its owner, whom he judged unworthy of this rare possession, or to take some sweeping and courageous measure and put it out of the reach of all mankind at once and forever, was a problem too grave to be decided in a moment. The manner in which it had come into his hands appeared manifestly providential; and as he took out the jewel and looked at it under the street lamps, its size and surprising brilliancy inclined him more and more to think of it as of an unmixed and dangerous evil for the world.
"God help me!" he thought; "if I look at it much oftener I shall begin to grow covetous myself." At last, though still uncertain in his mind, he turned his steps toward the small but elegant mansion on the riverside which had belonged for centuries to his royal family. The arms of Bohemia are deeply graved over the door and upon the tall chimneys; passengers have a look into a green court set with the most costly flowers, and a stork, the only one in Paris, perches on the gable all day long and keeps a crowd before the house.
Grave servants are seen passing to and fro within; and from time to time the great gate is thrown open and a carriage rolls below the arch. For many reasons this residence was especially dear to the heart of Prince Florizel; he never drew near to it without enjoying that sentiment of home-coming so rare in the lives of the great; and on the present evening he beheld its tall roof and mildly illuminated windows with unfeigned relief and satisfaction. As he was approaching the postern-door by which he always entered when alone, a man stepped forth from the shadow and presented himself with an obeisance in the Prince's path.
"I have the honor of addressing Prince Florizel of Bohemia?" said he. "Such is my title," replied the Prince. "What do you want with me?"  "I am," said the man, "a detective, and I have to present your Highness with this billet from the Prefect of Police.
" The Prince took the letter and glanced it through by the light of the street lamp. It was highly apologetic, but requested him to follow the bearer to the Prefecture without delay. "In short," said Florizel, "I am arrested. " "Your Highness," replied the officer, "nothing, I am certain, could be further from the intention of the Prefect.
You will observe that he has not granted a warrant. It is mere formality, or call it, if you prefer, an obligation that your Highness lays on the authorities. " "At the same time," asked the Prince, "if I were to refuse to follow you?" "I will not conceal from your Highness that a considerable discretion has been granted me," replied the detective with a bow.
"Upon my word," cried Florizel, "your effrontery astounds me!
Yourself, as an agent, I must pardon; but your superiors shall dearly smart for their misconduct. What, have you any idea, is the cause of this impolitic and unconstitutional act? You will observe that I have as yet neither refused nor consented, and much may depend on your prompt and ingenuous answer. Let me remind you, officer, that this is an affair of some gravity.
" "Your Highness," said the detective humbly, "General Vandeleur and his brother have had the incredible presumption to accuse you of theft. The famous diamond, they declare, is in your hands. A word from you in denial will most amply satisfy the Prefect; nay, I go further: if your Highness would so far honor a subaltern as to declare his ignorance of the matter even to myself, I should ask permission to retire upon the spot. " Florizel, up to the last moment, had regarded his adventure in the light of a trifle, only serious upon international considerations.
At the name of Vandeleur the horrible truth broke upon him in a moment; he was not only arrested, but he was guilty. This was not only an annoying incident it was a peril to his honor. What was he to say?
What was he to do? The Rajah's Diamond was indeed an accursed stone; and it seemed as if he were to be the last victim to its influence.
One thing was certain. He could not give the required assurance to the detective. He must gain time.
His hesitation had not lasted a second. "Be it so," said he, "let us walk together to the Prefecture. " The man once more bowed, and proceeded to follow Florizel at a respectful distance in the rear. "Approach," said the Prince. "I am in a humor to talk, and, if I mistake not, now I look at you again, this is not the first time that we have met.
" "I count it an honor," replied the officer, "that your Highness should recollect my face. It is eight years since I had the pleasure of an interview." "To remember faces," returned Florizel, "is as much a part of my profession as it is of yours.
Indeed, rightly looked upon, a Prince and a detective serve in the same corps. We are both combatants against crime; only mine is the more lucrative and yours the more dangerous rank, and there is a sense in which both may be made equally honorable to a good man. I had rather, strange as you may think it, be a detective of character and parts than a weak and ignoble sovereign."
The officer was overwhelmed. "Your Highness returns good for evil," said he. "To an act of presumption he replies by the most amiable condescension." "How do you know," replied Florizel, "that I am not seeking to corrupt you?" "Heaven preserve me from the temptation!" cried the detective.
"I applaud your answer," returned the Prince. "It is that of a wise and honest man. The world is a great place and stocked with wealth and beauty, and there is no limit to the rewards that may be offered.
Such a one who would refuse a million of money may sell his honor for an empire or the love of a woman; and I myself, who speak to you, have seen occasions so tempting, provocations so irresistible to the strength of human virtue, that I have been glad to tread in your steps and recommend myself to the grace of God. It is thus, thanks to that modest and becoming habit alone," he added, "that you and I can walk this town together with untarnished hearts. " "I had always heard that you were brave," replied the officer, "but I was not aware that you were wise and pious.
You speak the truth, and you speak it with an accent that moves me to the heart. This world is indeed a place of trial. " "We are now," said Florizel, "in the middle of the bridge. Lean your elbows on the parapet and look over. As the water rushing below, so the passions and complications of life carry away the honesty of weak men.
Let me tell you a story. " "I receive your Highness's commands," replied the man. And, imitating the Prince, he leaned against the parapet, and disposed himself to listen. The city was already sunk in slumber; had it not been for the infinity of lights and the outline of buildings on the starry sky, they might have been alone beside some country river.
"An officer," began Prince Florizel, "a man of courage and conduct, who had already risen by merit to an eminent rank, and won not only admiration but respect, visited, in an unfortunate hour for his peace of mind, the collections of an Indian prince. Here he beheld a diamond so extraordinary for size and beauty that from that instant he had only one desire in life: honor, reputation, friendship, the love of country, he was ready to sacrifice all for this lump of sparkling crystal. For three years he served this semi-barbarian potentate as Jacob served Laban; he falsified frontiers, he connived at murders, he unjustly condemned and executed a brother-officer who had the misfortune to displease the Rajah by some honest freedoms; lastly, at a time of great danger to his native land, he betrayed a body of his fellow-soldiers, and suffered them to be defeated and massacred by thousands. In the end, he had amassed a magnificent fortune, and brought home with him the coveted diamond. "Years passed," continued the Prince, "and at length the diamond is accidentally lost.
It falls into the hands of a simple and laborious youth, a student, a minister of God, just entering on a career of usefulness and even distinction. Upon him also the spell is cast; he deserts everything, his holy calling, his studies, and flees with the gem into a foreign country. The officer has a brother, an astute, daring, unscrupulous man, who learns the clergyman's secret. What does he do? Tell his brother, inform the police?
No; upon this man also the Satanic charm has fallen; he must have the stone for himself. At the risk of murder, he drugs the young priest and seizes the prey. And now, by an accident which is not important to my moral, the jewel passes out of his custody into that of another, who, terrified at what he sees, gives it into the keeping of a man in high station and above reproach. "The officer's name is Thomas Vandeleur," continued Florizel.
"The stone is called the Rajah's Diamond. And" suddenly opening his hand "you behold it here before your eyes." The officer started back with a cry.
"We have spoken of corruption," said the Prince. "To me this nugget of bright crystal is as loathsome as though it were crawling with the worms of death; it is as shocking as though it were compacted out of innocent blood. I see it here in my hand, and I know it is shining with hell-fire. I have told you but a hundredth part of its story; what passed in former ages, to what crimes and treacheries it incited men of yore, the imagination trembles to conceive; for years and years it has faithfully served the powers of hell; enough, I say, of blood, enough of disgrace, enough of broken lives and friendships; all things come to an end, the evil like the good; pestilence as well as beautiful music; and as for this diamond, God forgive me if I do wrong, but its empire ends to-night." The Prince made a sudden movement with his hand, and the jewel, describing an arc of light, dived with a splash into the flowing river.
"Amen," said Florizel, with gravity. "I have slain a cockatrice!"
"God pardon me!" cried the detective. "What have you done?
I am a ruined man." "I think," returned the Prince with a smile, "that many well to do people in this city might envy you your ruin.
" "Alas!
your Highness!" said the officer, "and you corrupt me after all?" "It seems there was no help for it," replied Florizel. "And now let us go forward to the Prefecture." Not long after, the marriage of Francis Scrymgeour and Miss Vandeleur was celebrated in great privacy; and the Prince acted on that occasion as groomsman. The two Vandeleurs surmised some rumor of what had happened to the diamond; and their vast diving operations on the River Seine are the wonder and amusement of the idle.
It is true that through some miscalculation they have chosen the wrong branch of the river. As for the Prince, that sublime person, having now served his turn, may go, along with the "Arabian Author," topsy-turvy into space. But if the reader insists on more specific information, I am happy to say that a recent revolution hurled him from the throne of Bohemia, in consequence of his continued absence and edifying neglect of public business; and that his Highness now keeps a cigar store in Rupert Street, much frequented by other foreign refugees.
I go there from time to time to smoke and have a chat, and find him as great a creature as in the days of his prosperity; he has an Olympian air behind the counter; and although a sedentary life is beginning to tell upon his waistcoat, he is probably, take him for all in all, the handsomest tobacconist in London. THE MYSTERY OF THE STEEL DISK  BY BROUGHTON BRANDENBURG  Broughton Brandenburg, a young Ohioan, was educated at Otterbein and Princeton Universities, became a war correspondent at twenty, serving in the Spanish-American and Boer wars, and shortly thereafter attracted attention as a traveler and sociological investigator. He studied immigration disguised as an Italian peasant, and sea-faring life as a common sailor and stevedore. Then he began to write sea stories, immigration articles, circus stories, and occasionally unusually interesting detective stories. "Lawrence Rand" has been the central figure in a number of tales notable for business-like handling of real people.
THE MYSTERY OF THE STEEL DISK  By BROUGHTON BRANDENBURG The telephone bell in the outer office rang, and opening the switch at the side of my desk I took up my stand-'phone and answered:  "Hello. Well?"  "Hello, is this Duncan & Betts?" inquired a man's voice with a slight foreign accent. "Yes."  "I want to speak wit' Mister Lawrence Duncan."
"This is Mr. Duncan. What can I do for you?"  "T'is is Mr. Martin Anderson of 196 Gramercy Park. Yust now while I was eating my breakwast in my rooms over my real estate office, I was called to my telephone by Mr. George Rhodes, who is in t'e Municipal Bank.
He is a young man who wants to marry my daughter Marie, and he called me up to tell me t'at when he opened t'e wault a little while ago he found t'at since he closed it t'e night before a package wit' more t'an a million dollars in bonds was gone. He is responsible for t'e wault and no one else, and he called me up to tell me, and say he did not take it, to tell Marie t'at, but he wit'drew his request for her hand. Now, t'en, Mr. Duncan, I don't care one tam about him, but my daughter must not be made to come in in t'is case wit' t'e noos-papers or t'e gossip, so I want you to go over to t'e bank and see him and help him out in every way, yust so he keep his mout' shut about Marie, and if t'ey lock him up I want t'at she don't get to see him or no such foolishness.
I send you my check for five hundred t'is morning, and I want to know all about what you do, at my house to-night. Will you do it?"
"Yes, I will go over at once," I answered. "T'at is all. Good-by "  "Thank you. Good-by.
I will call this evening." "Good-by, Mr. Duncan." My first impression as I hung up the receiver was a thrill at being thus thrust into the centre of what appeared to be one of the biggest cases which had transpired in years.
My second was a pleasurable recognition of the crisp, direct, clear, and ample statement of the matter which the old real estate man had made. It had all been done in two minutes or less. It is not often that we lawyers encounter people outside of our own and the newspaper profession who can state anything so concisely and not lose any value in it. At this moment, Betts, my partner, and the stenographer came in, so I hurried over to the Municipal Bank.
Business was just beginning for the day. I could see at a glance over the men behind the brass screens that they as a whole did not as yet know that the bank was a loser by a million. The cashier's door was open, and he was just smoothing out his morning mail in the calmest of manners. No one looked up as I entered; that showed normal state of mind among the clerks.
I asked for Mr. George Rhodes, and a tall, broad shouldered, clean-cut young chap came forward from a desk in the extreme rear of the place and took my card through the bars. Even with the slight view I could get of his face, I perceived he was pale and haggard. He opened a side door and admitted me to the anteroom of the directors' chamber. I told him I had come in his interest, retained by Mr. Anderson, and stated my client's reason for sending me, namely, to prevent his daughter's name from being mentioned in the matter at any or all times, and asked the young man what I could do for him.
He had been sitting running his thumb-nail precisely along the edge of my card, and now he looked up and said, in a dull, expressionless way:  "Really, Mr. Duncan, I have thought the matter over carefully, and there is nothing to do." He seemed so numbed and hopeless that I was amused. "You surprise me, Mr. Rhodes," I said. "Surely a thing like this can not in itself shut off any action. In the first place, give me the facts.
We will see what can be done." "The facts are few enough," he answered, simply. "The bonds were in a package four inches thick.
They were '90 government fours, clipped and worth one million two hundred thousand when entered the first of the month, three weeks ago. They were marked with a typewritten slip on the end and lay in the securities compartment of the vault. Last night, with the assistant cashier and the receiving teller, as is our rule here, I checked the cash and books going in.
We together do not check securities in that compartment except once every month, but I go over them every night and morning in the way that I was instructed by the cashier; that is, the packets are piled in alphabetical classification, and the piling is done so that if a packet were taken out it would make a hole which I should see at a glance, and by reference to my list see what it was. Last night there was nothing missing, for the pile was perfectly even across the top, and we closed the vault and set the time-lock. This morning the time-lock was still running when I arrived and the safe was absolutely just as I left it. When I opened the vault, I went over the securities as usual, and, observing a slight depression in the rear tier, put my hand on it.
It gave way enough to show something was missing, and I checked off the packets and found the '90 governments gone. I checked them over three times, and then, when I had got over the shock, went into the booth outside and telephoned Mr. Anderson just what I have told you. Having asked him for his daughter, I felt I owed that to them and to myself.
The assistant cashier and the assistant receiving teller were with me when I opened the vault, and I checked out the books and cash so that they know the safe had not been touched overnight; now you see it is up to me to account for those bonds. Mr. Anderson asked me to wait and see you before I told the cashier. The president is not down yet."
I had been watching him covertly as he spoke, and the instant that he had given me the case I felt the conviction stealing over me that he had the bonds, or had had them. The case of a small-salaried trust company clerk, who put four hundred thousand dollars of his employer's money into Wall Street in four weeks, rose in my mind. No matter, however, whether he had taken them or not, a fifteen or twenty years' term stared him in the face. Perhaps he thought that worth the gain. I supposed that, of course, he was bonded for one or two hundred thousand by some one of the fidelity companies, so I did not trouble to ask him as to that.
I merely remarked, drawing on my gloves:  "Well, Mr. Rhodes, I would advise you to put back the bonds if you can do it without detection, or else slide." A red flush crept up to his temples. It was either anger or guilt, probably both, but he controlled himself and said almost between his teeth, rising and turning away:  "I wish to bid you good-morning, Mr. Duncan.
You can go back to Mr. Anderson and tell him Marie will receive a last note from me in an hour, and now, if you will excuse me, I shall inform the cashier. " Something in his manner and the remembrance of his quixotic haste in calling up his sweetheart's father caused a pang of remorse to shoot through me and I put out my hand and stopped him. "I beg your pardon, Rhodes. I did not mean to be brutal, but the facts "  The tense line of his white lips relaxed into a sickly smile.
"Yes, the facts I know. I am not in a position to resent being reminded of them. But, I have made up my mind to tell the cashier.
" We left the room together, and I walked with him along the outer corridor to the cashier's door, where the stenographer said he had gone out, and we found the president would not be down until one o'clock. "See here, Rhodes," I said with sudden determination, "I'm going to do what I can in this matter. Is there any reason why it will become known as a matter of course?" "The first of the month, a week from to-morrow, will be the triple checking-up time.
" "Very well, just you hold off this morning, anyhow. You will probably have three-quarters of an hour for lunch; meet me at Haan's at 12:15." "All right.
Good-morning."
After I had gone twenty yards from the bank I was sorry that I had made the engagement. It was not in the line of my duty to my client, Mr. Anderson, and I was likely to become unprofitably involved with young Rhodes.
I saw, even without thought, that there were two alternatives. Either he had taken the bonds or they had been removed overnight from the vault, and I believed he was telling the truth when he said the vault was all right in the morning, for if it had not been, he would have eagerly seized on the circumstance; and furthermore, the fact would have been known by the other officials and the state of peace which I had found on entering would not have existed. There was but one thing to think: Rhodes had taken the bonds, or was shielding the thief. I related the case to Betts when I reached the office, and he laughed incredulously:  "Say, Duncan," he said, "that is a bit too wild a tale for me. Twelve hundred thousand dollars gone from a time-locked bank vault overnight without opening it!
Gee!
Why don't you consult that man Rand, Lawrence Rand, the fellow who has been untying some of those hard knots out West? Don't you remember the Johnstone mirror poisoning case and the Rebstock mines affair?" "Yes, I do.
Is Rand his name?
Where is he to be found?" "Jordan went up to his place one night I think it is in Fifty-seventh Street, in some apartment house. Here, look him up in the telephone book."
I found him entered there. "Lawrence Rand, Special Agent.
32088 Plaza.
" And calling him up made an engagement for an hour later. I was ushered into the reception-room of his apartment by a dark-skinned young giant, whom I at first thought a negro, but as I saw him in the full light and noted his straight hair and heavy coppery features, I was surprised to find he was a full-blooded Indian. He was dressed in clothes that did not seem compatible with the rank of a servant. Rand entered with a brisk step, a frank smile on his keen face. As he gripped my hand I realized that far more physical power was in his possession than one would think by his frame, of medium height and slender almost to thinness.
It was afterward that I found every inch of him was whipcord and steel. We sat down in the inner room and I told him the story of Rhodes and the bonds. When I had finished he frowned ever so slightly and said, "Is that all?"
I thought I had been rather explicit. So I replied with a little rigor: "That seems to cover the case."
"Do you know whether there is one night-watchman or two?
What is the make of the safe?
Have there ever been any attempts at robbery of the bank? Are all of the members of the bank staff present this morning? Has the president been on the right side of the market for the past year?"
The questions came like shots from a rapid-fire gun. He did not wait for me to answer. "I see you do not know. We will waste no time.
You are to meet young Rhodes at lunch. I want you to invite me, too, for I want to see him. " We took a Sixth Avenue train to Rector Street, and at 12:15 chose our seats in a corner compartment in Haan's. We had been at the table a moment when Rhodes, still very pale, entered and looked around for me.
As I introduced him to Rand, I noticed that the latter, after looking the bank clerk full in the eyes a second, let his gaze play like lightning over Rhodes's head and features, and before we sat down he even sought a pretext to step behind Rhodes and look at the back of his head. Rhodes was subjected to a severe questioning at once, and some of the queries seemed to be anything but relevant, and in sum were meant to make sure that it was impossible for any one but Rhodes to take the bonds at any time the safe was open. After the books and cash had been checked out, Rhodes said, a sliding steel screen was drawn over the approach to the vault at such times as he was not inside to get or replace papers or securities ordered out on written slip by some one of the officers. He was sure the bonds could not have been given out by mistake on a slip for other securities because the list tallied. "Then either you took the bonds or they were extracted from the safe after the time-lock was set, and the time-lock being all right up to the present minute, you are facing toward Sing Sing," summarized Rand, tilting his cigar and spilling salt into his beer.
Rhodes looked down and swallowed hard at something in his throat, but could not answer. "Who made the vault, when and where?" asked Rand. "Mahler, in 1890, in Cincinnati.
" "Hm, is that so a Mahler vault, eh?  Did I understand you to say the watchman is an old Irishman named Hanahan, has been at the bank twenty years and has considerable property?
How do you know about his property?" "When I was on accounts he always had fifteen or twenty thousand on time deposits, and drew some large checks or made heavy deposits when Mr. Anderson bought or sold property for him "  "Whom did you say, Mr. Anderson? The real estate agent who sent Mr. Duncan to see you?"  "Yes, Mr. Martin Anderson. He is Hanahan's agent. They were old volunteer firemen together in Williamsburg shortly after they came to this country."
"Indeed!  How do you know that?"
"Well, one evening shortly after I met Marie, I went to call on her and she said her father was not at home; that he was down at our bank chatting with Hanahan and having a smoke. Then she told me about their having belonged to the same fire company.
After the old man had taken a dislike to me and threatened to shoot me if I came to the house again, I used to watch for Hanahan's check, for every time he drew, I knew he was expecting to see Mr. Anderson and I would go up to the house. I never missed it." Rand smiled as if he enjoyed the humor in the instance. He thought a moment and then said:  "Well, now, if you will go back to the bank I will be over presently accompanied by a man from the Broadway office of Mahler's, and you will be asked to show us the vault.
Please do not indicate that you know me. " When Rhodes was gone, Rand turned to me quickly and said: "Mr. Duncan, kindly go over to Mr. Robert Steele in Hargan's office in Wall Street and tell him I sent you. Ask him whether any government fours of '90 have been in evidence in the market recently.
Meet me in half an hour at the telephone booth in the Park Row drug store."
I hurried to the office of the great firm of Hargan & Company and sent in my card to Mr. Steele with "through Mr. Rand" on the corner. I was ushered in immediately. "Mr. Steele, I was sent here by Mr. Rand to inquire whether there have been any '90 government fours on the market in more than the usual quantity recently?" At the question he started visibly and whirled abruptly around in his desk chair to face me.
He stared at me a moment as if weighing his words forthcoming. "Well yes," he said slowly, dropping his eyes in a manner that was anything but frank. "Yes, there have been some." He paused and looked up at me again, took off his glasses, and, wiping them tentatively, put them on and looked me full in the face as if decided on his course. "Since Mr. Rand sent you, it must be all right, for we trust Mr. Rand thoroughly here.
Tell him that a pile of them has been dumped into the market in the past week, not into the market exactly, but Strauss brokers had them and loans on them were used to buy Overland Pacific at an average of 87, and when it reached 161 last Thursday, whoever was in this pool began to take profits as nearly as we can tell and closed out the line at an average of 157. Of course Overland went to 136, but she is let me see let me see " he looked at the tape "is 206, so whoever held these bonds must have been outside of Strauss's pool. It cost us about three million dollars, and if you can tell me any more about it I will be very grateful. " I told him there was absolutely nothing of which I knew personally.
Suddenly I remembered that I had not learned even the name of the president of the Municipal Bank, and if Rand had asked Rhodes at lunch I had let it slip by me. Inwardly ashamed of my loose methods, compared with Rand's thorough ones, I hastened to ask of Mr. Steele, as a by-matter, being sure that he would know. I was at the door ready to go out when the matter flashed into my mind. "By the way, Mr. Steele," I said, "do you happen to know the president of the Municipal Bank "  "J. R. Farrington Smith?" He jerked his head around sharply toward me as he interrupted me.
"Indeed I do. " Then he emitted a short, grating laugh, and continued, looking at me sharply all the while: "How odd I should be thinking of him also at that moment! Do you know, Mr. Duncan, that Strauss is or was his broker? Yet, he was on the short end of Overland very badly; that I know, to my sorrow.
" He dropped his voice to a confidence-inviting tone, and said as he leaned forward, motioning me to a chair once more:  "Come now, Mr. Duncan, why should we dissemble? You are evidently very well informed in this matter. Did Smith flop and put up those bonds to go long on Overland?
He made a pretty penny if he did. Honestly, is that the way he played fast and loose with us?"
I remained standing and put on my hat to further signify that I was about to go. "Mr. Steele, to tell the truth, I did not know until a moment ago that J. R. Farrington Smith is president of the Municipal Bank. You have just informed me.
" He became very stiff in his manner, and turned to his papers as if already thinking of them, and said quietly:  "Oh, then we are talking to no purpose. Good morning, Mr. Duncan.
" By a short cut and a brisk walk up Nassau Street I reached the Park Row drug store on the minute of the half hour. A man was in the telephone booth talking, and just outside the half-open door was Rand, directing the queries that the man was making. The stranger was evidently the man from Mahler's.
As I approached Rand motioned me to silence. "Well, my books show the number is D186N," the safe man was saying; "we have no record of complaints or repairs back to '94. Have you any before that?
All right, I'll hold the wire. Hello, yes.
You have none at all. Now, what is the pattern of the time-lock?
Neilson patent, yes.
Well, who superintended the Secret Construction Room when this one was made? The old man himself, eh?
Where is Neilson now? How long has he been dead? Well, was his brother-in-law working with him in 1890? Wait a moment "  He kept the receiver to his ear and turned to Rand.
"Is there anything else you wish me to ask, Mr. Rand?" "Inquire if there has ever been any trouble with any D class vaults. That will be all. " The safe man repeated the question into the 'phone; received the answer, hung up the receiver, turned around and said:  "None but an attempt to blow one open in the Produce Exchange in Springfield.
It failed. He says the man who controlled the secret measurements on that set of vaults was the patentee of the time-lock and he is dead. The measurements are sealed and filed.
The patents went to his brother-in-law, who worked with him, who sold them outright to the company for a song." "What was his name?" asked Rand, with disappointment in his voice and manner. "They have no record and do not remember. He was just a drunken thick-headed Swede."
When Rand was paying the telephone toll the clerk figured on the rate to Cincinnati, so I knew they had been talking to the Mahler offices at the factory. I told Rand just what had happened in Steele's office, and he smiled slightly and said:  "Well, well, the lost bonds or others have been used as collateral for a week past, eh, and Farrington Smith was on the wrong side of the market? I do not think Rhodes will 'do any time' if he is clever. I have learned that he was a favorite employee of Smith's.
Let us go over to the Municipal." At the bank, the man from Mahler's spoke a moment to the cashier and received his permission to show the vault to "two prospective customers," and a boy was sent to tell Rhodes that the visitors had been accorded the courtesy. As we passed the president's inner office door, I saw Smith at his desk and noticed how pale and careworn he appeared.
I saw that Rand observed it also. Rhodes admitted us to the enclosure, and, according to Rand's previous instructions, gave us no sign of recognition. Rand and the man from Mahler's examined the interior of the electrically lighted vault. The safe man tapped the floor all around with the stick he carried, sounding for concealed tunneling, but the inspection was unfruitful.
The place was in perfect order, and the lock responded repeatedly to the safe man's skilled touch in a way that showed it was in excellent condition. Rand had been standing still, looking carefully at everything within range of his keen eyes, stroking his silver-touched hair lightly with one hand in a way I have observed many times since. Suddenly he pulled out his watch, looked at the dial of the time-lock, then at his watch, then at the bank clock, an electrically regulated affair hung on the wall. The clock read 2 P.M. to the second.
"I beg pardon," said Rand to Rhodes. "What time is it by your watch?"  Rhodes took out his timepiece, and said: "I have two o'clock flat." I now noticed that the dial of the time-lock stood 1.58:30.
"When did you notice that the clock of the time-lock was slow?" "It is slow, isn't it? Why, I had forgot that.
It was last Monday morning, a week ago. I remember I was a little late," replied Rhodes. "Has any one swept in here since?"  Rand asked this with his eyes fixed on a dark corner at the heel of the right door. "No, not in the vault."  Rand stooped and put his hand into the corner. For a moment I thought he was picking up something, but he straightened up and brushed his fingers one against the other as if ridding them of dust, so I knew his hands were empty.
In a moment he signified he was through and we left the place, and at the corner parted with the man from Mahler's. We walked on toward my office. "What do you make of that?" said Rand suddenly, and I saw that he was holding something toward me between his thumb and forefinger. I was sure he had put neither hand in his pockets since we had left the bank.
The small, bright object was merely a plain, smooth-worn bit of steel, thinner than a penny, and not as broad, with a small round hole in the centre. Just a tiny disk of steel.
"Did you pick that up in the vault?" I asked. "Yes, out of that dark corner by the door."
"Why, how is that? I saw your hands as you rose and they were empty." "Oh, no, you were mistaken, just as that man from Mahler's was.
I merely palmed the disk, that is all, so he could not see it. There is no reason why he should be on the inside of this case. He thinks too much of his own cleverness as it is." "Well, what is this thing?"
I said, slightly irritated at having been so easily tricked.
"I wish I could answer that question as easily as you ask it," replied Rand, and relapsed into silence. As we entered the building in which I had my office, there emerged from an elevator car that had just descended a girl, whose appearance caught my attention. She was attired in a dark street suit that set her small, trim figure to advantage, but by contrast emphasized the pallor of her face. Her hair was of that abundant flaxen quality so often seen in Germans and Scandinavians, and her eyes were large and dark blue. They were very troubled and it was plain she had been crying.
There was something bravely piteous in every line of her face. She paused a moment as if half expecting some one and hurried out as we entered the next up-bound car. When I went into the office, Betts came in with a slip of paper in his hand. After I had introduced him to Rand, he said:  "Duncan, for shame not to be in when nice young ladies call on you. The pretty daughter of your old real estate client, Anderson, was just here.
She has received a letter from the young fellow who took those bonds in which he says he wishes her to forget him. She refuses to believe he is guilty, and has had a scene with her father, who must have told her that he has retained you, for she came down here demanding that you take her to see the young chap, wherever he is locked up. Has he been arrested yet?"
"No," I said, "he is over in the bank." "I think he will be there for some time yet," observed Rand, looking out the window. "Well, she will be back in half an hour," said Betts, laying down the strip of paper on my desk.
"She did not have a card and wrote her name. Excuse me, Mr. Rand, I am not through with my correspondence yet, and it will soon be three o'clock." As Betts went out Rand rose and looked at the strip with the name written in a tall, delicate hand, "Miss Marie Neilson Anderson.
" In a short time Miss Anderson came into the outer office and I brought her in and closed the door. With trembling lips and tears constantly ready to fall, she repeated what she had already told Betts and demanded that I arrange an interview with Rhodes at once. I reassured her to the best of my ability. Rand sat quiet and said nothing.
I thought he might at least have repeated to her what he had just said to Betts, though I could not exactly make out what were his grounds for the statement. Instead, just before she was leaving, much comforted and calmer, he said:  "Excuse me, Miss Anderson, when did you last see Mr. Rhodes?"  "Oh, I have had a letter from him nearly every day, but I have not talked with him since Sunday night a week ago, when he came to see me at the house."
"How long have you known him?" "Nearly two years.
" "How did you meet him?" "Why, he knew papa at the bank, and one day when papa was ill he sent for George to come up to the house to get some papers about his accounts and papa introduced us.
When we were first engaged, he did not seem to dislike George, and often sat talking with him about matters in the bank and other things." "By the way, how old are you, Miss Anderson?"
She did not seem to mind the blunt question and replied quickly:  "I am twenty-one. " "Were you born in this country?" "Yes, I was born in New York." "Thank you, kindly; that is all," said Rand, and was promptly so deep in thought that he barely rose and bowed as she left a few minutes later.
He kept his feet and put on his hat as if he, too, were going. "I believe you told me that you were to go to Anderson's house to-night and report, did you not?" he asked. "Yes, I am sorry that I can not make a better showing both for my client and for Rhodes."
"I suppose you mean that you hoped a man of my reputation would have offered better support to you in yours," he observed with a quizzical smile that nettled me as he walked over to the door. "I should like to go with you, Mr. Duncan," he continued. "I will meet you at the northwest corner of Gramercy Park at eight o'clock.
Will you be so kind as to bring young Rhodes with you? 'Phone him at the bank, now, and you might come prepared for anything in the way of a fight for we will close up the case to-night. " He shut the door and went out.
I was wild to call him back and get an explanation, but pride restrained me. That evening Rhodes met me by appointment at the Fifth Avenue Hotel and we walked over to the corner Rand had named. We had been standing there a moment when a carriage drove up, stopped, and Rand alighted, followed by J. R. Farrington Smith and the brawny Indian. I could see by the street light that Smith was very white, and the Indian kept just at his elbow and a little behind him as they advanced to meet us.
Rand presented me to Smith, who bowed coldly. If Smith and Rhodes exchanged salutations I did not notice it. Rand said to me as we walked along to the house after he had told the cabman to wait for him:  "Will you kindly ask Mr. Anderson to see Mr. Duncan and some gentlemen?" I was angry with him for a number of small things which had occurred during the day, but more than ever now for bringing Smith into the case, and at Anderson's house, a proceeding which would be sure to involve Anderson and his daughter in the exposé that must occur in so short a time.
A little maid admitted us at a door beside Anderson's real estate office, and passed back along a narrow hall and up to a well-furnished apartment immediately over the offices. The maid vanished through portières, and I judged by the sounds that she found Anderson in the third room to the rear. I could hear him clearing his throat as he came.
As he stepped through the portières, I saw he was a man of fifty, of good appearance, short and heavy, with large hands and a massive jaw. His eyes were very small and nearly hidden by the overfolding wrinkles about them. "Good-evening, gentlemen," he said cheerily, looking about in a pleasant though puzzled way. I rose and went forward, saying:  "I am Mr. Duncan, Mr. Anderson.
I believe you know Mr. Smith and Mr. Rhodes. This is Mr. Lawrence Rand, with whom I have consulted in this matter." The Indian, whom I scarcely knew how to consider, whether companion of Rand's or his servant, had stepped back into the shadow by the portières, and I do not think Anderson saw him, so I made no reference to him whatever.
I was very busy thinking just what to say and how to say it, for Rand's bringing Smith with him showed Smith was informed in part or wholly, and was so unexpected that I had had no chance to ask him aside just what the situation was. He left me in no uncertainty. He gracefully superseded me in the initiative by drawing back a chair at a small table in the centre of the room, in the full glow of the shaded light, and saying:  "Would you mind sitting here, please, Mr. Anderson?
I shall want you to write something in a moment and it will be more convenient for you." Anderson sat down, as requested, and turned his face toward Rand as if he knew where the power lay.
I could see the arteries in his neck throbbing. I noticed that Rhodes was very pale, and the bank president was laboring under great excitement. "Now, to be brief, gentlemen, we are about to adjust this matter of the disappearance of twelve hundred thousand dollars' worth of bonds from the vault of the Municipal Bank."
Rand spoke in a soft even voice. I think I was the only man who moved a muscle. I could see that at least Anderson's blood did not quicken any. His eyes may have turned toward Rhodes.
I could not tell. Rand went on:  "Before I say anything further, I wish to remind the interested parties that I have brought an officer with me and any violence would be inadvisable. "Mr. Anderson, you will kindly turn over to Mr. Smith that packet of '90 government fours.
Mr. Smith will give you a receipt in full. You will also give Mr. Smith your order on Strauss & Company for four hundred thousand dollars, which is approximately what Mr. Smith lost when caught short on Overland Pacific ten days ago, and also your order to Mr. George Rhodes for the remainder of your profits when you went long on Overland Pacific this last week by using the Municipal Bank as an involuntary partner. You will also give your consent to his marriage with your daughter. Mr. Duncan here will arrange the matter of fees and that will close the incident.
If you do not, Mr. Smith will prosecute you and I will furnish the evidence. If Mr. Smith does not perform his share I will, in behalf of Mr. Rhodes, inform the bank directors of his hand in Overland.
Kindly do as I have requested, Mr. Anderson." The old fellow never changed color one whit, nor did the throbbing of the arteries in his neck increase.
They diminished, if anything. A bitter sneer came on his face, and as he spoke he dropped into very broken English. "Vot iss diss nonsense, Meester, vot-afer-your nem-iss?  Vot a ni'ice liddle scheme bote Ah don't ma'eke no mohney baycoss Ah aindt got dey bonts-s "  Rand held up a forefinger and the old man stopped.
He was now breathing hard and was flushed. Rand drew from his vest pocket and laid on the table before Anderson the little steel disk. Before Rand could speak, the portières parted, and in the opening stood Marie Anderson, very white and drawn up to her full height. In one hand she extended the packet with the typewritten slip still on the end.
"Father," she said slowly, in a low, tense voice, "here are the bonds. By accident I just found them in a jar on the sideboard. " With surprising quickness Anderson drew out a drawer in the table at which he sat, snatched up a revolver, leaped to the doorway, thrusting his daughter aside, but as he turned and fired pointblank at Rand, who had vaulted the table to reach him, the Indian knocked up the muzzle of the revolver from behind. The bullet struck the ceiling and the next instant Anderson was on the floor, helpless in the bearlike clasp of the big red man.
The girl had reeled as if about to faint. Rhodes had sprung to her assistance, but she recovered herself and seemed to be anxious to get away from her father, as if from a reptile. Rhodes led her to the other side of the room. "Take the gun away from him and set him on the chair again, Tom," said Rand, as if nothing had happened.
He returned to his own seat, and we too sat down. In fifteen seconds the smoke floating about the ceiling was the only sign of the crisis just passed. Rand began again:  "In order to give you an opportunity to recover your composure before you begin writing, Mr. Anderson, and to prevent your indulging in any more foolish lies, I will tell you the evidence against you. You helped your brother-in-law, Neilson, make the time-lock on the vault ordered for the Municipal Bank in 1890. You inserted in the journal of the main standard of the clock works a steel disk instead of a brass one, knowing that the steel against steel would make a friction that would wear out both in several years' time.
By means of a second time-lock accurately duplicated, and which, if I am not mistaken, is ticking away in that black box on the mantel behind you, you were able to tell very nearly the very hour when you could turn back the bolts of the Municipal vault without let or hindrance. When your brother-in-law died, you sold his patents to the company, returned to New York, and began to live for the hour when you could help yourself to whatever you wished. You stopped drinking and settled down. You went into the real estate business because you could obtain in that manner a permanent hold on Hanahan, the watchman at the Municipal, whom you already knew, and you drew him into the habit of seeing you on business regularly at the bank at night.
You have his perfect confidence. When you found that about the time you were ready to make your haul George Rhodes would be the young man in charge of the vault, you called him to the house on a pretext and made him acquainted with your daughter and encouraged his visits that you might get from him in your chats, bit by bit, knowledge of just what to put your hand on in the short time you were in the vault, and how to conceal the theft long enough for you to convert the securities. This is one of the deepest and cleverest criminal plots of which I have ever heard. Your life for all these years has been devoted to it.
I am not surprised that you succeeded. Your one mistake was in giving so flimsy a pretext to Mr. Duncan for calling him up and retaining him. That attracted my attention to you.
What you really wanted was to be able to have constant information from Mr. Duncan when he should become Rhodes's counsel in the natural course of events, as to efforts to explain the disappearance of the bonds in order to defend Rhodes. In that way you would always know how close he was on the track of the real thief, Mr. Martin Anderson.
Few men pay attorneys $500 retaining fees to persuade young men who really love their daughters from dragging them into a scandal which does not essentially concern the daughters at best. You were surprised into this mistake when Rhodes called you up and crystallized your plan to force your choice of counsel on him too hastily. "On Sunday night a week ago you went to the bank, as your duplicate time-lock showed you the steel disk was worn so thin a jar on the door would cause the standard to drop and the lock to release. Hanahan, as he told me an hour ago, went across the street for some tobacco that Sunday night, leaving you in the bank.
In ninety seconds you had opened the vault, taken the right packet, opened the case of the time-lock, replaced the disk with a brass one, closed the case, and closed the vault, but you carelessly dropped this worn disk on the floor. "You used the bonds as collateral to buy stock, not as a speculation, but as an investment that would conceal the bonds, and by chance chose Overland Pacific at a low figure and it rose. You thought best to take your profits, and only your greed prevented you from returning the bonds to Rhodes by mail.
As we have seen, you had not thought long enough or deeply enough what you would do with your lifetime harvest after you got it in your hands, and suddenly you found yourself out of your depth. You hid the bonds in a jar, just like a foolish old woman. But I must compliment you on your clear thinking and previous planning.
I have never known of anything so deliberate, and only a phlegmatic Scandinavian would be capable of it, especially to end up with such good nerves as you have shown to-night. Mr. Smith does not wish to prosecute you and expose his speculations. Since Mr. Smith and Mr. Duncan doubtless have other engagements to-night, kindly write as I requested a few minutes ago."
Muttering objurgations in his native tongue, Anderson wrote the two drafts, Rhodes's being for more than one hundred thousand, and both Rhodes and Smith receipted. Smith took the bonds and thrust them into his overcoat pocket. Miss Anderson refused to remain an hour longer under her father's roof, and left the house to go to the home of a distant relative. I pocketed the odd little steel disk, which lies before me as I write, with a slip copied from a page of Rand's notebook that lays out so plainly and simply his quick, sure, and unerring processes in this remarkable case, that I can not refrain from giving it.
(1) Anderson's retaining Duncan very strange.
(2) Rhodes's cranium shows moral incapacity for theft. Innocent.
(3) Neilson's brother-in-law could know lock construction. (4) Smith lost speculating. Thief won half million with bonds.
(5) Time-clock lost 90 sec. Sunday night, week before discovery.
(6) Disk of steel instead of brass.
Meant to wear out. Is discarded part of lock. Must be a new disk in lock.
Work of expert.
Prepared since making of lock. (7) Marie Neilson Anderson.
(8) Anderson was alone in bank 3 min. Sunday night of robbery. Anderson guilty.
Proved and confessed. Adjusted, no proceedings, by L. R. THE CHRONICLES OF ADDINGTON PEACE  BY B. FLETCHER ROBINSON Fletcher Robinson is a London journalist, the editor of "Vanity Fair," and author of a dozen detective stories in which are recorded the startling adventures of Mr. Addington Peace of Scotland Yard. He collaborated with Conan Doyle in "The Hound of the Baskervilles."
When some of these stories appeared in the American magazines, for an unexplained reason (presumably editorial) the name of the hero was changed to Inspector Hartley.
THE CHRONICLES OF ADDINGTON PEACE By B. FLETCHER ROBINSON THE VANISHED MILLIONAIRE  I, James Phillips, stood with my back to the fire, smoking and puzzling over it. It was worth all the headlines the newspapers had given it; there was no loophole to the mystery. Both sides of the Atlantic knew Silas J. Ford.
He had established a business reputation in America that had made him a celebrity in England from the day he stepped off the liner. Once in London his syndicates and companies and consolidations had startled the slow-moving British mind. The commercial sky of the United Kingdom was overshadowed by him and his schemes. The papers were full of praise and blame, of puffs and denunciations.
He was a millionaire; he was on the verge of a smash that would paralyze the markets of the world. He was an abstainer, a drunkard, a gambler, a most religious man. He was a confirmed bachelor, a woman hater; his engagement was to be announced shortly.
So was the gossip kept rolling with the limelight always centred upon the spot where Silas J. Ford happened to be standing. And now he had disappeared, vanished, evaporated. On the night of December 18, a Thursday, he had left London for Meudon Hall, the fine old Hampshire mansion that he had rented from Lord Beverley.
The two most trusted men in his office accompanied him. Friday morning he had spent with them; but at three o'clock the pair had returned to London, leaving their chief behind. From four to seven he had been shut up with his secretary. It was a hard time for every one, a time verging upon panic, and at such times Silas J. Ford was not an idle man.
At eight o'clock he had dined. His one recreation was music, and after the meal he had played the organ in the picture gallery for an hour. At a quarter past eleven he retired to his bedroom, dismissing Jackson, his body servant, for the night. Three-quarters of an hour later, however, Harbord, his secretary, had been called to the private telephone, for Mr. Ford had brought an extension wire from the neighboring town of Camdon. It was a London message, and so urgent that he decided to wake his chief.
There was no answer to his knock, and on entering the room he found that Mr. Ford was not in bed. He was surprised, but in no way suspicious, and started to search the house. He was joined by a footman, and, a little later, by Jackson and the butler. Astonishment changed to alarm.
Other servants were roused to aid in the quest. Finally, a party, provided with lanterns from the stables, commenced to examine the grounds. Snow had fallen early in the day, covering the great lawns in front of the entrance porch with a soft white blanket, about an inch in thickness. It was the head groom who struck the trail.
Apparently Mr. Ford had walked out of the porch, and so over the drive and across the lawn toward the wall that bounded the public road. This road, which led from Meudon village to the town of Camdon, crossed the front of Meudon Hall at a distance of some quarter of a mile. There was no doubt as to the identity of the footprints, for Silas Ford affected a broad, square-toed boot, easily recognizable from its unusual impression. They tracked him by their lanterns to the park wall, and there all trace of him disappeared.
The wall was of rough stone, easily surmountable by an active man. The snow that covered the road outside had been churned into muddy paste by the traffic of the day; there were no further footprints observable. The party returned to the house in great bewilderment.
The telephone to London brought no explanation, and the following morning Mr. Harbord caught the first train to town to make inquiries. For private reasons his friends did not desire publicity for the affair, and it was not until the late afternoon, when all their investigations had proved fruitless, that they communicated with Scotland Yard. When the papers went to press the whereabouts of the great Mr. Ford still remained a mystery. In keen curiosity I set off up the stairs to Inspector Peace's room.
Perhaps the little detective had later news to give me. I found him standing with his back to the fire puffing at his cigarette with a plump solemnity. A bag, neatly shaped, lay on the rug at his feet. He nodded a welcome, watching me over his glasses.
"I expected you, Mr. Phillips," he said. "And how do you explain it?"
"A love affair or temporary insanity," I suggested vaguely. "Surely we can combine those solutions," he smiled.
"Anything else?"
"No.  I came to ask your opinion." "My mind is void of theories, Mr. Phillips, and I shall endeavor to keep it so for the present. If you wish to amuse yourself by discussing possibilities, I would suggest your consideration of the reason why, if he wanted to disappear quietly, he should leave so obvious a track through the snow of his own lawn. For myself, as I am leaving for Camdon via Waterloo Station in ten minutes, I shall hope for more definite data before night." "Peace," I asked him eagerly, "may I come with you?"
"If you can be ready in time," he said.
It was past two o'clock when we arrived at the old town of Camdon. A carriage met us at the station. Five minutes more and we were clear of the narrow streets and climbing the first bare ridge of the downs. It was a desolate prospect enough a bare expanse of wind-swept land that rose and fell with the sweeping regularity of the Pacific swell. Here and there a clump of ragged firs showed black against the snow.
Under that gentle carpet the crisp turf of the crests and the broad plow lands of the lower ground alike lay hidden. I shivered, drawing my coat more closely about me. It was half an hour later that we topped a swelling rise and saw the gray towers of the ancient mansion beneath us. In the shelter of the valley by the quiet river, that now lay frozen into silence, the trees had grown into splendid woodlands, circling the hall on the further side. From the broad front the white lawns crept down to the road on which we were driving.
Dark masses of shrubberies and the tracery of scattered trees broke their silent curves. The park wall that fenced them from the road stood out like an ink line ruled upon paper. "It must have been there that he disappeared," I cried, with a speculative finger. "So I imagine," said Peace. "And if he has spent two nights on the Hampshire downs, he will be looking for a fire to-day.
You have rather more than your fair share of the rug, Mr. Phillips, if you will excuse my mentioning it." A man was standing on the steps of the entrance porch when we drove up. As we unrolled ourselves he stepped forward to help us. He was a thin, pale-faced fellow, with fair hair and indeterminate eyes. "My name is Harbord," he said.
"You are Inspector Addington Peace, I believe." His hand shook as he stretched it out in a tremulous greeting. Plainly the secretary was afraid, visibly and anxiously afraid. "Mr. Ransome, the manager of Mr. Ford's London office, is here," he continued.
"He is waiting to see you in the library." We followed him through a great hall into a room lined with books from floor to ceiling. A stout, dark man, who was pacing it like a beast in a cage, stopped at the sight of us. His face, as he turned it toward us, looked pinched and gray in the full light.
"Inspector Peace, eh?" he said. "Well, Inspector, if you want a reward, name it. If you want to pull the house down, only say the word. But find him for us, or, by heaven, we're done."  "Is it as bad as that?"
"You can keep a secret, I suppose.
Yes it couldn't well be worse. It was a tricky time; he hid half his schemes in his own head; he never trusted even me altogether. If he were dead I could plan something, but now "  He thumped his hand on the table and turned away to the window.
"When you last saw Mr. Ford was he in good health?  Did he stand the strain?"  "Ford had no nerves. He was never better in his life." "In these great transactions he would have his enemies. If his plans succeeded there would be many hard hit, perhaps ruined. Have you any suspicion of a man who, to save himself, might make away with Mr. Ford?"
"No," said the manager after a moment's thought. "No, I can not give you a single name. The players are all big men, Inspector. I don't say that their consciences would stop them from trying such a trick, but it wouldn't be worth their while.
They hold off when jail is the certain punishment." "Was this financial crisis in his own affairs generally known?"  "Certainly not." "Who would know of it?"  "There might be a dozen men on both sides of the Atlantic who would suspect the truth.
But I don't suppose that more than four people were actually in possession of the facts."
"And who would they be?"
"His two partners in America, myself, and Mr. Harbord there.
" Peace turned to the young man with a smile and a polite bow. "Can you add any names to the list?" he asked. "No," said Harbord, staring at the detective with a puzzled look, as if trying to catch the drift of his questions. "Thank you," said the Inspector; "and now will you show me the place where this curious disappearance occurred?"
We crossed the drive, where the snow lay torn and trampled by the carriages, and so to the white, even surface of the lawn. We soon struck the trail, a confused path beaten by many footprints.
Peace stooped for a moment, and then turned to the secretary with an angry glance. "Were you with them?" he said. "Yes."  "Then why, in the name of common sense, didn't you keep them off his tracks? You have simply trampled them out of existence, between you." "We were in a hurry, Inspector," said the secretary meekly.
"We didn't think about it. " We walked forward, following the broad trail until we came to a circular patch of trodden snow. Evidently the searchers had stopped and stood talking together. On the further side I saw the footprints of a man plainly defined.
There were some half-dozen clear impressions and they ended at the base of the old wall, which was some six feet in height. "I am glad to see that you and your friends have left me something, Mr. Harbord," said the Inspector. He stepped forward and, kneeling down, examined the nearest footprint. "Mr. Ford dressed for dinner?" he inquired, glancing up at the secretary. "Certainly!  Why do you ask?"  "Merely that he had on heavy shooting boots when he took this evening stroll.
It will be interesting to discover what clothes he wore." The Inspector walked up to the wall, moving parallel to the tracks in the snow. With singular activity for his plump and unathletic figure he climbed to the top and seated himself while he stared about him.
Then on his hands and knees he began to crawl forward along the coping. It was a quaint spectacle, but the extraordinary care and vigilance of the little man took the farce out of it. Presently he stopped and looked down at us with a gentle smile. "Please stay where you are," he said, and disappeared on the further side. Harbord offered me a cigarette, and we waited with due obedience till the Inspector's bullet-head again broke the horizon as he struggled back to his position on the coping of the wall.
He seemed in a very pleasant temper when he joined us; but he said nothing of his discoveries, and I had grown too wise to inquire. When we reached the entrance hall he asked for Jackson, the valet, and in a couple of minutes the man appeared. He was a tall, hatchet-faced fellow, very neatly dressed in black. He made a little bow, and then stood watching us in a most respectful attitude.
"A queer business this, Jackson," said Addington Peace. "Yes, sir."
"And what is your opinion on it?" "To be frank, sir, I thought at first that Mr. Ford had run away; but now I don't know what to make of it."
"And why should he run away?" "I have no idea, sir; but he seemed to me rather strange in his manner yesterday.
" "Have you been with him long?"
"No, sir. I was valet to the Honorable John Dorn, Lord Beverley's second son. Mr. Ford took me from Mr. Dorn at the time he rented the Hall. " "I see.
And now will you show me your master's room? I shall see you again later, Mr. Harbord," he continued; "in the meanwhile I will leave my assistant with you." We sat and smoked in the secretary's room. He was not much of a talker, consuming cigarette after cigarette in silence.
The winter dusk had already fallen when the Inspector joined us, and we retired to our rooms to prepare for dinner. I tried a word with Peace upon the staircase, but he shook his head and walked on. The meal dragged itself to an end somehow, and we left Ransome with a second decanter of port before him. Peace slipped away again, and I consoled myself with a book in the library until half-past ten, when I walked off to bed. A servant was switching off the light in the hall when I mounted the great staircase.
My room was in the old wing at the further side of the picture gallery, and I had some difficulty in steering my way through the dark corridors. The mystery that hung over the house had shaken my nerves, and I remember that I started at every creak of a board and peered into the shadows as I passed along with, Heaven knows, what ghostly expectations. I was glad enough to close my door upon them and see the wood fire blazing cheerfully in the open hearth. I woke with a start that left me sitting up in bed, with my heart thumping in my ribs like a piston rod.
I am not generally a light sleeper, but that night, even while I snored, my nerves were active. Some one had tapped at my door that was my impression. I listened with the uncertain fear that comes to the newly waked. Then I heard it again on the wall near my head this time.
A board creaked. Some one was groping his way down the dark corridor without. Presently he stopped, and a faint line of illumination sprang out under my door.
It winked, and then grew still. He had lighted a candle. Assurance came with the streak of light. What was he doing, groping in the dark, if he had a candle with him?
I crept over to the door, opened it, and stared cautiously out. About a dozen feet away a man was standing, a striking figure against the light he carried. His back was toward me, but I could see that his hand was shading the candle from his eyes while he stared into the shadows that clung about the further end of the corridor. Presently he began to move forward.
The picture gallery and the body of the house lay behind. The corridor in which he stood terminated in a window, set deep into the stone of the old walls. The man walked slowly, throwing the light to right and left. His attitude was of nervous expectation that of a man who looked for something that he feared to see.
At the window he stopped, staring about him and listening. He examined the fastenings, and then tried a door on his right. It was locked against him. As he did so I caught his profile against the light. It was Harbord, the secretary.
From where I stood he was not more than forty feet away. There was no possibility of a mistake. As he turned to come back I retreated into my room, closing the door. The fellow was in a state of great agitation, and I could hear him muttering to himself as he walked. When he had passed by I peeped out to see him and his light dwindle, reach the corner by the picture gallery, and fade into a reflection, a darkness.
I took care to turn the key before I got back into bed. I woke again at seven, and, hurrying on my clothes, set off to tell Peace all about it. I took him to the place, and together we examined the corridor. There were only two rooms beyond mine.
The one on the left was occupied by Ransome; that on the right was a large store-room, the door of which was locked. The housekeeper kept the key, we learned upon inquiry. Whom had Harbord followed? The problem was beyond me. As for Inspector Peace, he did not indulge in verbal speculations.
It was in the central hall that we encountered the secretary on his way to the breakfast-room. The man looked nervous and depressed; he nodded to us and was passing on, when Peace stopped him. "Good-morning, Mr. Harbord," he said. "Can I have a word with you?"
"Certainly, Inspector.
What is it?" "I have a favor to ask. My assistant and myself have our hands full here. If necessary, could you help us by running up to London and "  "For the day?" he interrupted.
"No.  It may be an affair of three or four days. " "Then I must refuse. I am sorry, but "  "Don't apologize, Mr. Harbord," said the little man, cheerfully. "I shall have to find some one else, that is all.
" We walked into the breakfast-room, and a few minutes later Ransome appeared with a great bundle of letters and telegrams in his hand. He said not a word to any of us, but dropped into a chair, tearing open the envelopes and glancing at their contents. His face grew darker as he read, and once he thumped his hand upon the table with a crash that set the china jingling. "Well, Inspector?" he said at last. The little detective's head shook out a negative.
"Perhaps you require an incentive," he sneered. "Is it a matter of a reward?" "No, Mr. Ransome; but it is becoming one of my personal reputation."
"Then, by thunder, you are in danger of losing it. Why don't you and your friend hustle instead of loitering around as if you were paid by the job? I tell you, man, there are thousands, hundreds of thousands melting, slipping through our fingers, every hour of the day."
He sprang from his seat and started his walk again, up and down, up and down, as we had first seen him. "Shall you be returning to London?"
At the question the manager halted in his stride, staring sharply down into the Inspector's bland countenance. "No," he said; "I shall stay here, Mr. Addington Peace, until such time as you have something definite to tell me."
"I have an inquiry to make which I would rather place in the hands of some one who has personal knowledge of Mr. Ford. Neither Mr. Harbord nor yourself desire to leave Meudon. Is there any one else you can suggest?"
"There is Jackson, Ford's valet," said the manager, after a moment's thought. "He can go if you think him bright enough. I'll send for him."
While the footman who answered the bell was gone upon his errand we waited in an uneasy silence.
There was the shadow of an ugly mystery upon us all. Jackson, as he entered, was the only one who seemed at his ease. He stood there, a tall figure of all the respectabilities.
"The Inspector here wishes you to go to London, Jackson," said the manager. "He will explain the details. There is a fast train from Camdon at eleven. " "Certainly, sir.
Do I return to-night?"
"No, Jackson," said Peace. "It will take a day or two." The man took a couple of steps toward the door, hesitated, and then returned to his former place.
"I beg your pardon, sir," he began, addressing Ransome. "But I would rather remain at Meudon under present circumstances." "What on earth do you mean?" thundered the manager. "Well, sir, I was the last to see Mr. Ford.
There is, as it were, a suspicion upon me. I should like to be present while the search continues, both for his sake and my own. " "Very kind of you, I'm sure," growled Ransome. "But you either do what I tell you, Jackson, or you pack your boxes and clear out.
So be quick and make up your mind." "I think you are treating me most unfairly, sir. But I can not be persuaded out of what I know to be my duty.
" "You impertinent rascal! " began the furious manager. But Peace was already on his feet with a chubby hand outstretched.
"Perhaps, after all, I can make other arrangements, Mr. Ransome," he said. "It is natural that Jackson should consider his own reputation in this affair. That is all, Jackson; you may go now." It was half an hour afterward, when the end of breakfast had dispersed the party, that I spoke to Peace about it, offering to go to London myself and do my best to carry out his instructions.
"I had bad luck in my call for volunteers," he said. "I should have thought they would have been glad enough to get the chance of work. They can find no particular amusement in loafing about the place all day." "Doubtless they all had excellent reasons," he said with a smile.
"But, anyway, you can not be spared, Mr. Phillips. " "You flatter me." "I want you to stay in your bedroom.
Write, read, do what you like, but keep your door ajar. If any one passes down the corridor, see where he goes, only don't let him know that you are watching him if you can help it. I will take my turn at half-past one. I don't mean to starve you." I obeyed.
After all, it was, in a manner, promotion that the Inspector had given me; yet it was a tedious, anxious time. No one came my way, barring a sour-looking housemaid. I tried to argue out the case, but the deeper I got the more conflicting grew my theories. I was never more glad to see a friendly face than when the little man came in upon me.
The short winter's afternoon crept on, the Inspector and I taking turn and turn about in our sentry duty. Dinner-time came and went. I had been off duty from nine, but at ten-thirty I poured out a whisky and soda and went back to join him. He was sitting in the middle of the room smoking a pipe in great apparent satisfaction. "Bed-time, isn't it?"
I grumbled, sniffing at his strong tobacco.
"Oh, no," he said. "The fact is, we are going to sit up all night." I threw myself on a couch by the window without reply.
Perhaps I was not in the best of tempers; certainly I did not feel so. "You insisted on coming down with me," he suggested. "I know all about that," I told him.
"I haven't complained, have I? If you want me to shut myself up for a week I'll do it; but I should prefer to have some idea of the reason why."  "I don't wish to create mysteries, Mr. Phillips," he said kindly; "but believe me there is nothing to be gained in vague discussions. " I knew that settled it as far as he was concerned, so I nodded my head and filled a pipe. At eleven he walked across the room and switched off the light.
"If nothing happens you can take your turn in four hours from now," he said. "In the meanwhile get to sleep.  I will keep the first watch." I shut my eyes, but there was no rest in me that night. I lay listening to the silence of the old house with a dull speculation.
Somewhere far down in the lower floor a great gong-like clock chimed the hours and quarters. I heard them every one, from twelve to one, from one to two. Peace had stopped smoking. He sat as silent as a cat at a mousehole.
It must have been some fifteen minutes after two that I heard the faint, faint creak of a board in the corridor outside. I sat up, every nerve strung to a tense alertness. And then there came a sound I knew well, the soft drawing touch of a hand groping in the darkness as some one felt his way along the paneled walls. It passed us and was gone.
Yet Peace never moved.
Could he have fallen asleep? I whispered his name. "Hush!"
The answer came to me like a gentle sigh.
One minute, two minutes more and the room sprang into sight under the steady glow of an electric hand-lamp. The Inspector rose from his seat and slid through the door with me upon his heels. The light he carried searched the clustered shadows; but the corridor was empty, nor was there any place where a man might hide. "You waited too long," I whispered impatiently.
"The man is no fool, Mr. Phillips. Do you imagine that he was not listening and staring like a hunted beast?
A noisy board, a stumble, or a flash of light, and we should have wasted a tiring day. " "Nevertheless he has got clear away." "I think not."  As we crept forward I saw that a strip of the oak flooring along the walls was gray with dust.
If it had been in such a neglected state in the afternoon I should surely have noticed it. In some curiosity I stooped to examine the phenomenon. "Flour," whispered the little man touching my shoulder. "Flour?"  "Yes.
I sprinkled it myself. Look there is the first result."
He steadied his light as he spoke, pointing with his other hand. On the powdery surface was the half footprint of a man.
The flour did not extend more than a couple of feet from the walls, so that it was only here and there that we caught up the trail. We had passed the bedroom on the left yet the footprints still went on; we were at the store-room door, yet they still were visible before us. There was no other egress from the corridor. The tall window at the end was, as I knew, a good twenty feet from the ground.
Had this man also vanished off the earth like Silas Ford? Suddenly the inspector stopped, grasping my arm. The light he held fell upon two footprints close together. They were at right angles to the passage. Apparently the man had passed into the solid wall!
"Peace, what does this mean?" You, sir, sitting peaceably at home, with a good light and an easy conscience, may think I was a timid fool; yet I was afraid honestly and openly afraid. The little detective heard the news of it in my voice, for he gave me a reassuring pat upon the back. "Have you never heard of a 'priest's hole'?" he whispered. "In the days when Meudon Hall was built, no country house was without its hiding-place.
Protestants and priests, Royalists and Republicans, they all used the secret burrow at one time or another. " "How did he get in?"
"That is what we are here to discover, and as I have no wish to destroy Mr. Ford's old oak panels I think our simplest plan will be to wait until he comes back again." The shadows leaped upon us as Peace extinguished the light he carried. The great window alone was luminous with the faint starlight that showed the tracery of its ancient stonework; for the rest, the darkness hedged us about in impenetrable barriers.
Side by side, we stood by the wall in which we knew the secret entrance must exist. It may have been ten minutes or more when from the distance somewhere below our feet, or so it seemed to me there came the faint echo of a closing door. It was only in such cold silence that we could have heard it.
The time ticked on. Suddenly, upon the black of the floor, there shone a thin reflection like the slash of a sword a reflection that grew into a broad gush of light as the sliding panel in the wall, six feet from where we stood, rose to the full opening. There followed another pause, during which I could see Peace draw himself together as if for some unusual exertion.
A shadow darkened the reflection on the floor, and a head came peering out. The light but half displayed the face, but I could see that the teeth were bare and glistening, like those of a man in some deadly expectation. The next moment he stepped across the threshold.
With a spring like the rush of a terrier, Addington Peace was upon him, driving him off his balance with the impact of the blow. Before I could reach them, the little detective had him down, though he still kicked viciously until I lent a hand. The click of the handcuffs on his wrist ended the matter.
It was Ford's valet, the man Jackson. We were not long by ourselves. I heard a key turned in the lock, and Ransome burst out of his room into the corridor like an angry bull. Almost at the same moment there sounded a quick patter of naked feet from behind us, and Harbord, the secretary, came running up, swinging a heavy stick in his hand.
They both stopped at the edge of the patch of light in which we were, staring from us to the gaping hole in the wall. "What in thunder are you about?" cried the manager. "Finding a solution to your problem," said the little detective, getting to his feet.
"Perhaps, gentlemen, you will be good enough to follow me." He stepped through the opening in the wall, and lifted the candle which the valet had placed on the floor while he was raising the panel from within. By its light I could see the first steps of a flight which led down into darkness. "We will take Jackson with us," he continued. "Keep an eye on him, Mr. Phillips, if you please.
" It was a strange procession that we made. First Peace, with the candle, then Ransome, with the valet, following, while I and Harbord brought up the rear. We descended some thirty steps, formed in the thickness of the wall, opened a heavy door, and so found ourselves in a narrow chamber, some twelve feet long by seven broad. Upon a mattress at the further end lay a man, gagged and bound.
As the light fell upon his features, Ransome sprang forward, shouting his name. "Silas Ford, by thunder!"
With eager fingers we loosened the gag and cut the ropes that bound his wrists. He sat up, turning his long, thin face from one to the other of us as he stretched the cramp from his limbs.
"Thank you, gentlemen," said he. "Well, Ransome, how are things?"  "Bad, sir; but it's not too late." He nodded his head, passing his hands through his hair with a quick, nervous movement. "You've caught my clever friend, I see. Kindly go through his pockets, will you?
He has something I must ask him to return to me. " We found it in Jackson's pocket-book a check, antedated a week, for five thousand pounds, with a covering letter to the manager of the bank. Ford took the bit of stamped paper, twisting it to and fro in his supple fingers. "It was smart of you, Jackson," he said, addressing the bowed figure before him: "I give you credit for the idea.
To kidnap a man just as he was bringing off a big deal well, you would have earned the money." "But how did you get down here?" struck in the manager. "He told me that he had discovered an old hiding-place a 'priest's hole,' he called it and I walked into the trap as the best man may do sometimes. As we got to the bottom of that stairway he slipped a sack over my head and had me fixed in thirty seconds.
He fed me himself twice a day, standing by to see I didn't halloo. When I paid up he was to have twenty-four hours' start; then he would let you know where I was. I held out awhile, but I gave in to-night. The delay was getting too dangerous.
Have you a cigarette, Harbord?
Thank you. And who may you be?" It was to the detective he spoke.
"My name is Peace, Inspector Addington Peace, from Scotland Yard. " "And I owe my rescue to you?"
The little man bowed. "You will have no reason to regret it. And what did they think had become of me, Inspector?"  "It was the general opinion that you had taken to yourself wings, Mr. Ford. " It was as we traveled up to town next day that Peace told me his story.
I will set it down as briefly as may be. "I soon came to the conclusion that Ford, whether dead or alive, was inside the grounds of Meudon Hall. If he had bolted, for some reason, by the way, which was perfectly incomprehensible, a man of his ability would not have left a broad trail across the centre of his lawn for all to see. There was, moreover, no trace of him that our men could ferret out at any station within reasonable distance.
A motor was possible, but there were no marks of its presence next morning in the mud of the roads. That fact I learned from a curious groom who had aided in the search, and who, with a similar idea upon him, had carefully examined the highway at daybreak. "When I clambered to the top of the wall I found that the snow upon the coping had been dislodged. I traced the marks, as you saw, for about a dozen yards.
Where they ended I, too, dropped to the ground outside. There I made a remarkable discovery. Upon a little drift of snow that lay in the shallow ditch beneath were more footprints.
But they were not those of Ford.
They were the marks of long and narrow boots, which led into the road, where they were lost in the track of a flock of sheep that had been driven over it the day before. "I took a careful measurement of those footprints. They might, of course, belong to some private investigator; but they gave me an idea.
Could some man have walked across the lawn in Ford's boots, changed them to his own on the top of the wall, and so departed? Was it the desire of someone to let it be supposed that Ford had run away? "When I examined Ford's private rooms I was even more fortunate.
From the boot-boy I discovered that the master had three pairs of shooting boots. There were three pairs in the stand. Some one had made a very serious mistake. Instead of hiding the pair he had used on the lawn, he had returned them to their place.
The trick was becoming evident. But where was Ford?
In the house or grounds, dead or alive, but where?  "I was able, through my friend the boot-boy, to examine the boots on the night of our arrival. My measurements corresponded with those that Jackson, the valet, wore. Was he acting for himself, or was Harbord, or even Ransome, in the secret? That, too, it was necessary to discover before I showed my hand.
"Your story of Harbord's midnight excursion supplied a clue. The secretary had evidently followed some man who had disappeared mysteriously. Could there be the entrance to a secret chamber in that corridor?
That would explain the mystification of Harbord as well as the disappearance of Silas Ford. If so, Harbord was not involved. "If Ford were held a prisoner he must be fed.
His jailer must of necessity remain in the house. But the trap I set in the suggested journey to town was an experiment singularly unsuccessful, for all the three men I desired to test refused.
However, if I were right about the secret chamber I could checkmate the blackmailer by keeping a watch on him from your room, which commanded the line of communications.
But Jackson was clever enough to leave his victualing to the night-time.
I scattered the flour to try the result of that ancient trick. It was successful. That is all.
Do you follow me?"
"Yes," said I; "but how did Jackson come to know the secret hiding place?"
"He has long been a servant of the house. You had better ask his old master." Now, as I pondered the implications of Jackson's familiarity with the house, I considered the relationships between the staff. They had served together for years, and loyalty, I mused, could be as binding as a chain.
It was clear that if Jackson knew the secrets of the household, then he could very well have orchestrated the entire affair. My thoughts turned to Ransome, who had been unusually quiet since the incident. What if he had been complicit?
As I reviewed the events, I noted the strange happenings that had unfolded over the past few days. Ford's sudden disappearance, Harbord's late-night excursions, and the constant comings and goings of the staff suggested a web of intrigue.
Perhaps there was more to this than mere chance. I decided to employ a different tactic. Instead of confronting Jackson directly, I would observe him from a distance. With careful planning, I could ascertain whether he was in league with the others or simply a pawn in a larger game. The following day, I feigned a casual interest in the household chores, allowing me to blend in.
My keen observation skills would serve me well, for I knew that the truth lay hidden beneath layers of deception. As I moved about the house, I overheard snippets of conversation among the staff. Their whispers carried hints of discontent and mistrust.
It seemed that Jackson was not the only one who held secrets. I noted that Harbord had been particularly agitated, and I wondered if he had been feeling the pressure of scrutiny. What did he know that he wasn't revealing? Later that evening, I resolved to make my move.
As darkness enveloped the estate, I carefully navigated my way toward the corridor where the mysterious entrance might be concealed. With each step, I felt the weight of the mystery pressing upon me. Would I uncover the truth behind Ford’s disappearance, or was I destined to stumble into a trap set by an unseen hand?
Suddenly, I heard a faint noise—like a whisper carried on the wind. My heart raced as I approached the door at the end of the hall. It creaked open, revealing a dimly lit passage that seemed to stretch endlessly into the shadows. Determined, I stepped inside, the air thick with anticipation.
Here was the chance to find answers, and perhaps save Ford if he was indeed in peril. As I ventured deeper, the atmosphere shifted. The walls seemed to close in around me, and every sound echoed ominously. I reached for my flashlight, illuminating the path ahead. What secrets lay in the darkness?
I knew I had to remain vigilant; the stakes were higher than I could have ever imagined. The passage twisted and turned, leading me to a heavy door. My instincts screamed that this was where I would find the answers.
With a steadying breath, I pushed it open, ready to face whatever awaited me on the other side. As I stepped over the threshold, the door creaked ominously behind me, and I found myself in a dimly lit chamber. The air was stale, carrying a sense of neglect that hinted at secrets long hidden.
Dust motes danced in the beam of my flashlight as I scanned the room, searching for any signs of life or evidence that could lead me to Ford. My eyes fell upon an old trunk nestled in the corner, its surface covered in a thick layer of dust. It seemed out of place, an artifact from a time when this chamber might have been vibrant with activity.
I approached cautiously, each step echoing in the silence. The trunk's latch was rusty, but it yielded easily to my touch. Inside, I discovered a collection of letters tied with a fraying ribbon, their edges yellowed with age. With trembling hands, I began to sift through the letters.
They contained correspondence between Ford and a mysterious figure known only as 'M.' The letters hinted at a clandestine meeting, a conspiracy that could unravel everything I thought I knew about the people in this house. The mention of a 'secret chamber' sent a chill down my spine. As I read on, I could hardly believe my eyes. The letters revealed that Ford had been involved in something much larger than himself—something that could endanger not just his life but the lives of everyone associated with him.
I needed to find him and understand the full extent of the situation. Suddenly, I heard footsteps approaching from the corridor outside. Panic surged through me as I quickly stuffed the letters back into the trunk and closed it, wiping the dust from my hands. I held my breath and pressed myself against the wall, hoping to remain unseen.
The door swung open, and in stepped Jackson, his demeanor betraying no hint of the secret I had just uncovered. He surveyed the room, his sharp eyes scanning every corner. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as he paused just a few feet away from my hiding place.
"What are you doing here?" I almost gasped as I recognized Harbord’s voice behind him. Jackson replied coolly, "Just checking on the storeroom. It’s been neglected for too long.
" My mind raced. They were on to something, but what? Were they aware of my presence? I had to act quickly before they uncovered the truth I had stumbled upon. As they turned their backs to me, I seized the opportunity to slip further into the shadows.
I knew I had to gather more information before confronting them. Their conversation revealed nothing more of immediate value, but I felt the tension between them. It was clear that both had their own agendas, and neither could be trusted. Once they left the chamber, I took a moment to collect myself. The letters were a key to understanding Ford's predicament, and I needed to devise a plan to confront him without revealing my hand too soon.
As I exited the room, I decided to retrace my steps and explore the grounds outside. Perhaps there I could find further clues about the people involved in this mystery. My instincts told me that I was getting closer to the truth, but I had to remain vigilant.
The night air was cool against my skin, and the moon cast an ethereal glow over the estate. I wandered the grounds, searching for signs of life, anything that might lead me to Ford. Then I spotted a flicker of light in the distance—a lantern swaying gently as if someone was moving about in the garden. Curiosity piqued, I made my way toward it, moving quietly through the shadows.
As I drew nearer, I recognized the figure silhouetted against the light. It was Ford! Relief washed over me, but I knew that I had to approach with caution. What was he doing out here alone? Did he have any idea of the danger he was in?
I decided to conceal myself behind a large bush, waiting for the right moment to reveal myself. My heart raced as I watched him. His face was drawn and weary, but there was a determination in his posture that told me he was not one to be easily cowed.
Finally, I stepped forward, emerging from the shadows. "Ford!"
I called softly, trying to keep my voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through me. He turned, startled at first, but recognition quickly replaced his fear. "Who goes there?" he asked, squinting into the darkness.
"It’s me," I replied, stepping into the light of the lantern. "We need to talk. There’s much at stake.
" Ford looked around cautiously before gesturing for me to come closer. "You shouldn’t be here," he warned, glancing back toward the house. "It’s not safe."
"I know," I said, urgency lacing my voice. "But we don’t have time to waste.
We need to get to the bottom of this before it’s too late. " As we began to discuss our next steps, I couldn't shake the feeling that we were being watched. The shadows seemed to stretch longer, and the air was thick with tension. Time was running out, and we were not alone in our pursuit of the truth.
As Ford and I conversed in hushed tones, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were on the brink of uncovering something monumental. Our discussion revolved around the letters, the mysterious 'M,' and the potential for a secret chamber hidden somewhere in the estate. “What did you find in the house?” Ford asked, his voice tense with urgency. “I discovered some letters,” I replied, lowering my voice even further. “They suggest you’ve been involved in something dangerous. You need to tell me everything you know about this ‘M’ and what you’re entangled in.” Ford hesitated, his gaze shifting uneasily. “I thought I could handle it,” he finally confessed.
“I didn’t want to drag anyone else into this, but it’s spiraling out of control.” I placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “You’re not alone in this.
We’ll figure it out together, but we need to act fast.” Just then, the sound of footsteps crunching on gravel interrupted us. Ford and I exchanged alarmed glances, instinctively retreating into the cover of shadows. “Did you hear that?” he whispered, his eyes wide with fear. I nodded, straining to listen. The footsteps grew closer, accompanied by low voices murmuring just beyond our hiding place.
I felt the tension in the air heighten as we pressed ourselves against the thick foliage, hoping to remain unseen. “Let’s move,” I urged, my mind racing with options. We had to get away before we were discovered, but where could we go that would be safe? As the voices drifted closer, I recognized one of them—Harbord.
The other was less familiar, but I could sense their urgency. They were searching for something, or someone. “We have to split up,” I suggested quickly.
“I’ll draw them away, and you find a place to hide. Stay low, and don’t make a sound.” Ford nodded, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. “Be careful,” he whispered. Taking a deep breath, I slipped out of our hiding spot and made my way toward the garden’s edge. My heart raced as I heard Harbord’s voice more clearly now, demanding to know where Ford had gone.
“Check the stables!” Harbord ordered. “He can’t be far. He wouldn’t risk being out here alone.” I quickly ducked behind a nearby tree, watching as they moved toward the stables.
My mind raced with possibilities. If they found Ford, all would be lost. I had to think strategically.
As I observed their movements, I noticed that the garden was more expansive than I had realized. There was a narrow pathway leading to the back of the estate, an area that appeared less traversed. It was risky, but it might provide the cover we needed. Cautiously, I made my way down the path, taking care to avoid any branches that could betray my presence.
The muffled sounds of their search echoed behind me, but I kept my focus ahead. Once I reached a dense thicket at the far end of the garden, I paused to catch my breath. My mind raced with thoughts of Ford and the danger he was in. I couldn’t let fear paralyze me; I had to be brave.
Just then, a soft rustle caught my attention. I turned to find a small, hidden entrance partially concealed by vines. My instincts kicked in—this could be another potential escape route or perhaps even the secret chamber hinted at in the letters. I approached cautiously, peering through the foliage.
The entrance appeared dark and foreboding, but if there was a chance it could lead to answers, I had to explore it. With a quick glance over my shoulder to ensure Harbord and his companion were still occupied, I pushed aside the vines and squeezed through the narrow opening. The air inside was cool and damp, a stark contrast to the humid night outside. As I stepped into the chamber, I felt a sense of trepidation wash over me.
The faint glow of moonlight filtered through cracks in the walls, illuminating the space just enough for me to navigate. I moved carefully, scanning the surroundings for anything that could provide insight into Ford’s situation. The chamber was cluttered with forgotten relics and dusty furniture, remnants of a time long past.
Then I spotted something—a wooden chest against the far wall, slightly ajar. My heart raced as I approached it. What secrets lay inside?
With trembling hands, I opened the chest fully. Inside, I found a collection of items: a bloodstained handkerchief, a revolver, and several more letters, this time addressed to 'M.' My heart sank as I read through the contents. It was clear that Ford had been caught in a web of deception and danger far beyond my initial understanding.
The letters hinted at betrayal, clandestine meetings, and a plot that could endanger many lives, including our own. As I pieced together the fragments of this new puzzle, I knew I had to regroup with Ford and share my findings. Time was of the essence; we needed to act before 'M' or Harbord could strike again.
I quickly retraced my steps, moving stealthily through the garden. My thoughts were a whirlwind of questions. Who was 'M,' and what did they want with Ford?
What was the true nature of this conspiracy? As I neared the spot where I had last seen Ford, a sudden chill crept down my spine.
I felt the presence of someone watching me, a shadow lurking just out of sight. My instincts screamed at me to be cautious, but I couldn’t turn back now. “Ford!” I whispered urgently, hoping he was still safe. But the only reply was the rustling of leaves, and the shadows seemed to grow darker around me.
I had to find him before it was too late. As I waited for a response from Ford, the silence grew thick and oppressive. I could feel the weight of my surroundings pressing in on me, the shadows dancing around the edges of my vision. I was on high alert, aware that danger could be lurking at any moment.
“Ford!” I called out again, my voice barely more than a whisper. The night air was heavy with anticipation, and I strained to listen for any signs of movement. Suddenly, a branch snapped behind me, and I whirled around, heart pounding. From the shadows, a figure emerged—tall and menacing, cloaked in darkness.
I recognized him instantly: it was Jackson, the valet. “What are you doing here?” I demanded, instinctively stepping back into the cover of the thicket. “Looking for you, of course,” Jackson replied smoothly, his tone deceptively calm.
“I see you’ve been busy, rummaging through places that don’t concern you.” I narrowed my eyes at him, my pulse racing. “What do you know about Ford?
Where is he?” Jackson shrugged, a smirk playing at the corners of his mouth. “That depends on how far you’re willing to go to find out. He’s in deeper trouble than you realize.” “What does that mean?” I pressed, fighting the urge to flee. “You know something! Tell me!” “Why should I?” he taunted, stepping closer.
“You have no power here. You’re just a curious little fool who’s wandered too far into a game you don’t understand.” I felt a surge of frustration and fear.
“If you know anything, you need to help us. This is serious!” “Serious?” Jackson echoed, chuckling softly. “You have no idea how serious it is. But maybe I can make a deal with you.
You provide me with something useful, and I might consider telling you where Ford is.” “What kind of deal?” I asked, incredulity creeping into my voice. “I want to know what you’ve found in that chest,” he replied, his eyes gleaming with a mix of greed and cunning. “Give me the letters, and I’ll tell you where to find your precious Ford.” I hesitated, weighing my options.
The letters contained vital information, but the thought of leaving Ford’s fate in Jackson’s hands was equally troubling. If I didn’t act fast, I might lose both him and the chance to uncover the truth. “Why should I trust you?” I asked, trying to stall for time. Jackson stepped closer, invading my personal space.
“Because I know more than you think. I can help you—if you let me. Or you can continue this foolish quest alone and face the consequences.” Just then, the night was pierced by the distant sound of voices. Panic surged through me as I realized Harbord and his companion might be drawing closer.
“I don’t have time for this,” I said, determination setting in. “I’ll find Ford on my own.” Before Jackson could react, I darted past him, heart racing. I had no idea where I was going, but I couldn’t risk being caught here. I navigated through the dense underbrush, my mind racing as I recalled the layout of the estate.
If I could reach the stables, I might find a way to escape or discover where Ford was being held. As I neared the stable area, I could hear the faint whinnying of horses and the clatter of hooves. I glanced back, and to my dismay, I saw Jackson emerging from the thicket, his expression darkening as he followed me.
“Stop!” he shouted, the threat clear in his voice. “You’re making a mistake!” Ignoring him, I pressed on, my only focus being Ford’s safety. I slipped into the stable, ducking behind a large hay bale to catch my breath and collect my thoughts.
The interior was dimly lit, the scent of hay and animals filling the air. My heart raced as I considered my next move. I needed to be stealthy, to avoid drawing attention while I searched for any sign of Ford.
Peeking out from my hiding spot, I scanned the stable. There were two horses, saddled and ready, and to my relief, I noticed Ford’s familiar brown coat draped over a nearby saddle. He had been here recently. Just then, I heard footsteps approaching. I crouched lower, my breath hitching in my throat as the figures entered the stable.
It was Harbord and another man I didn’t recognize. “Ford has to be around here somewhere,” Harbord said, his voice low and urgent. “We can’t let him get away.” “What if he has already left?” the other man asked. “He could have taken off with the horses.” “No,” Harbord insisted. “He wouldn’t leave without making sure he had a plan. He knows we’re onto him.” My heart sank.
They were close, and if they found me, everything would be over. I needed a distraction, something to divert their attention. I scanned the stable, my eyes landing on a bucket hanging from the wall, filled with grain. With a quick flick of my wrist, I knocked it over, sending grain spilling across the ground.
“What was that?” Harbord exclaimed, turning sharply toward the noise. Using their moment of distraction, I slipped out from behind the hay bale and made my way toward the back of the stable. I had to find Ford before they caught on to what was happening. As I crept further into the shadows, I heard whispers coming from one of the stalls.
I paused, straining to listen. “...he won’t find us here. We just need to stay hidden a little longer,” a voice said. It was Ford!
Relief washed over me, and I rushed toward the stall, peeking inside. There he was, looking disheveled but alive. He met my gaze, surprise flickering in his eyes. “Thank goodness you found me!” he exclaimed in a hushed voice. “I was afraid I’d be stuck here forever.” “Not yet,” I replied urgently. “We have to get out before they realize we’re together. Come on!” We moved quietly, careful not to alert Harbord and his companion. As we neared the entrance of the stable, I could hear them growing more agitated, searching for us among the stalls. “Where could they have gone?” Harbord said, frustration evident in his tone. “Maybe we should check the back exit,” the other man suggested.
“Let’s split up,” Harbord ordered. “I’ll take the front. You check the back.” My heart raced as I and Ford slipped out the side entrance just in time, narrowly avoiding being caught.
The moonlight illuminated our path as we dashed into the night. “Where do we go now?” Ford asked, glancing back toward the stable.
“We need to find a place to hide and come up with a plan,” I replied, scanning our surroundings. The estate was sprawling, with woods surrounding the edges. If we could make it to the treeline, we might have a chance.
With Ford beside me, we sprinted toward the woods, the sound of pursuit echoing behind us. As we reached the treeline, I glanced back to see Harbord and the other man exiting the stable, their faces twisted in anger and confusion. “Quick, this way!” I urged Ford as we dove into the cover of the trees. The darkness enveloped us, providing a temporary sense of safety.
I leaned against a tree, trying to catch my breath. “We have to think strategically,” I said, my mind racing. “They’ll come after us. We can’t let them find us again.” Ford nodded, determination shining in his eyes.
“I’m with you. Whatever it takes, we’ll uncover the truth and get to the bottom of this.” As we made our way deeper into the woods, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were on the verge of unraveling a conspiracy that reached far beyond our understanding. Each step forward was laced with uncertainty, but I knew we had to press on.
The night was far from over, and our journey had just begun. As we trudged through the underbrush, the sounds of the night enveloped us. The rustling leaves and distant hoots of owls provided an eerie soundtrack to our escape.
Each crack of a twig underfoot felt amplified, and I couldn’t shake the paranoia that someone was still watching us. “Do you think they’ll follow us?” Ford whispered, glancing back toward the estate. “I’m sure they will,” I replied, keeping my voice low.
“We need to find a place to lay low for a while.” We pressed deeper into the woods, where the canopy thickened, providing more cover. The moonlight filtered through the leaves, casting eerie shadows that danced around us. I could feel the tension between us as we navigated through the dimly lit terrain, my mind racing with questions about what we’d stumbled into. “Do you have any idea what’s really going on here?” I asked Ford, trying to gather my thoughts. He hesitated, glancing around as if weighing his words. “There are things I suspect, but it’s all connected to something bigger than just me. I believe Ford was caught in a web of deceit and greed.” I nodded, piecing together the fragments of our situation.
“Jackson seemed to know more than he was letting on. And Harbord is definitely not to be trusted. We have to figure out who else is involved.” Ford stopped and turned to face me, urgency etched on his features.
“If we can find evidence of their scheme, we might be able to expose them. But we have to be careful.
They’re dangerous.” I agreed. We had to gather information without drawing attention to ourselves.
“Let’s find a safe place to regroup and come up with a plan.” We continued to move quietly until we spotted an old hunting cabin nestled among the trees. It appeared abandoned, but it could provide us with a temporary refuge.
“Over there,” I pointed. “That cabin might work.” As we approached, I checked the surroundings for any signs of life. The door creaked as we entered, and dust motes danced in the beams of moonlight that streamed through the cracks. Inside, it was sparse—an old table, a few chairs, and a fireplace long since used. “This will have to do,” Ford said, surveying the area.
“At least we can gather our thoughts here.” We took a moment to catch our breath, the weight of our escape finally settling in. I leaned against the wall, my mind racing with possibilities. “First things first,” I began, “we need to figure out our next move.
We can’t stay here too long.” Ford nodded, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. “We should consider finding allies. Someone who can help us navigate this mess.” “Agreed,” I replied, pacing the small cabin.
“But who can we trust?” As if sensing my agitation, Ford spoke up. “What about that boot-boy you mentioned? He seems to know a lot about the goings-on in the house.” I paused, considering his suggestion.
“You’re right. He might be our best lead. If we can get to him, he may have information that could help us.” “Let’s wait until dawn,” Ford suggested. “We’ll have a better chance of sneaking back to the estate in the daylight.” I agreed, knowing we had to be strategic.
As we settled in for the night, I couldn’t shake the feeling of dread that lingered. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the occasional creak of the cabin settling. “Do you think we’re safe here?” Ford asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“For now,” I replied, though uncertainty gnawed at me. “But we can’t let our guard down. If they’re looking for us, they might come this way.” As the hours passed, I felt the weight of fatigue pressing down on me. My mind raced with thoughts of Ford, the boot-boy, and the danger that awaited us.
I couldn’t afford to let my emotions cloud my judgment. With the first light of dawn creeping through the cracks in the cabin, I woke with a start. Ford was already awake, his eyes alert and focused. “It’s time,” he said, determination in his gaze. “Let’s move before they notice we’re gone.” We gathered ourselves and slipped out of the cabin, the cool morning air refreshing against my skin.
The woods felt alive, the sounds of birds heralding the new day. “Stick close to me,” I instructed as we navigated back through the trees toward the estate. As we reached the edge of the property, I could see the mansion in the distance, looming like a fortress. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what lay ahead. “We need to find the boot-boy before anyone else does,” I said.
Ford nodded, and together we crept toward the house, scanning for any signs of movement. I spotted the stable in the distance, the horses still milling about. “Let’s check there first,” I suggested, pointing. As we approached, we heard the sound of footsteps, and I motioned for Ford to hide behind a nearby tree.
I peered around the corner to see Jackson walking toward the stable, a determined look on his face. “Where is he?” Jackson muttered to himself, glancing around as if he sensed we might be nearby. I exchanged a worried glance with Ford.
“He’s looking for us. We need to be quick.” As Jackson entered the stable, we slipped inside the shadows, careful not to make a sound. My heart raced as I scanned the area, hoping to spot the boot-boy. “Over there!” Ford whispered, pointing to a shadowy corner of the stable. I moved silently toward the figure, recognizing him as the boot-boy.
“Hey!” I hissed, crouching down beside him. He looked up, wide-eyed. “You!
I thought you’d been caught!” “We need your help,” I said urgently. “What do you know about Ford’s disappearance?” “I’ve heard things,” he replied, glancing toward the entrance nervously.
“They’re involved in something big—something that goes beyond just Ford. You have to be careful.” “Tell us everything,” I insisted, my voice low but firm. “We don’t have much time.” He nodded, glancing around as if to ensure we were alone. “They’ve been planning something for weeks.
It involves a shipment of something valuable, and Ford got too close to the truth. That’s why they’re after him.” “Where is he being held?” Ford asked, desperation creeping into his voice.
“Somewhere in the estate,” the boot-boy replied. “I overheard them talking about a hidden room, but I don’t know where. You’ll need to find the layout of the place.” “Is there a way to access the house without being seen?” I asked, my mind racing with possibilities. “Yes, there’s a back entrance that leads to the basement,” he explained.
“You can slip in there, but you need to move quickly. If they catch you—” “I know, I know,” I interrupted, feeling the pressure of time pressing down on us. “We have to act now.” Ford and I exchanged determined glances. “We’ll find Ford, no matter what,” I said resolutely. “Be careful,” the boot-boy warned.
“If they see you, it could be the end for all of us.” With that, we slipped out of the stable, hearts pounding in our chests as we made our way toward the back of the estate. The sun was rising higher now, casting long shadows across the ground. I could feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins, pushing us forward as we navigated toward the entrance the boot-boy had described.
“This is it,” I whispered, glancing around to ensure we weren’t being watched. We approached the door, my heart racing with anticipation and fear. “Ready?” Ford nodded, determination etched on his face.
“Let’s do this.” Taking a deep breath, I pushed the door open and stepped into the darkness beyond. We were entering the belly of the beast, and there was no turning back. The air inside the basement was musty and cold, a stark contrast to the bright morning outside. Shadows danced on the walls, flickering in the dim light as we crept forward, our senses heightened.
I strained to listen for any sounds that might indicate someone was nearby. “This way,” I whispered to Ford, leading him down a narrow corridor. The walls were lined with old crates and dusty furniture, remnants of what once might have been a storage area.
We moved cautiously, each step echoing softly in the silence. I could feel my pulse pounding in my ears as I peered around a corner, hoping to catch a glimpse of anything that might guide us. “Look,” Ford murmured, pointing to a small door at the far end of the hall. It was slightly ajar, a faint light seeping through the crack. I nodded, my heart racing as we approached.
“That might be it.” As we neared the door, a sound broke the stillness—a faint, muffled cry echoed from behind it. My heart sank. It was Ford’s voice.
“Ford!” I exclaimed, rushing forward. I pushed the door open wider, revealing a small, dimly lit room. Inside, tied to a chair, was Ford.
Relief washed over me as I hurried toward him. “We’re here! We’re going to get you out!” He looked up, eyes filled with hope and concern. “Be careful!
They could be close.” I quickly began to untie him, glancing over my shoulder to ensure we weren’t ambushed. “We need to move fast,” I urged, working frantically at the knots that bound him. Once free, Ford rubbed his wrists, a determined look on his face.
“Thank you. We need to get out of here before they find out.” “Do you know the way back?” I asked, scanning the room for any possible exit routes.
“Yes, follow me,” he said, leading the way back to the corridor. As we made our way back, the tension in the air thickened. I could feel the dread settling in my stomach.
Every creak of the floorboards sounded like an alarm. Suddenly, I heard footsteps approaching. “Hurry!” I hissed, pushing Ford toward a side door I noticed earlier. We slipped inside just as the footsteps grew louder.
The door closed with a soft click, and we held our breath, listening intently. “Where are they?” a voice called from the hallway, the tone heavy with suspicion. “They can’t be far,” another voice responded. “Search every room!” I exchanged a panicked glance with Ford.
“We need to find a way out, now.” The small room we had entered was cramped and filled with old boxes. “This could be a storage area,” I whispered, hoping there might be a back exit.
“Let’s check for windows,” Ford suggested, moving toward the far wall. We quickly rummaged through the boxes, our hearts pounding as we searched for an escape route. “Nothing,” I muttered, frustration mounting.
Then, Ford shouted, “Here!” He had discovered a small window, just big enough to squeeze through. “Can you fit?” I asked, assessing the opening. “I’ll try,” he said, positioning himself at the window. I helped him maneuver his body through, holding my breath as he disappeared outside. “Come on, hurry!” I urged, glancing back toward the door as the voices grew closer.
Finally, Ford reached back in for me, and I climbed up, squeezing through the window. I tumbled out onto the soft grass below, gasping for fresh air. “Quick!” he whispered, scanning the area for any signs of movement. We crouched low and began to make our way toward the tree line, hoping to remain unseen. I glanced back at the house, anxiety gnawing at my insides.
We couldn’t let them catch us again. “Where to now?” Ford asked, breathing heavily as we ducked behind a bush. “We need to get to the main road,” I replied, my mind racing. “From there, we can find help or a car.” We navigated through the underbrush, careful to stay out of sight.
The sounds of the house faded behind us, but the fear of being caught lingered. Just as we reached the edge of the trees, a shout echoed behind us. “They’re getting away!” “Run!” I shouted, adrenaline kicking in as we sprinted toward the road.
Our feet pounded against the ground, the distance between us and our pursuers narrowing. I could hear the sounds of footsteps behind us, growing louder as they chased us down. “There!” Ford pointed toward a small car parked at the side of the road. “We can use that!” We dashed toward the vehicle, heart pounding with hope. I fumbled with the door handle, my fingers shaking. “It’s locked!” I cursed under my breath. “Let me,” Ford said, taking a step back. He smashed the window with a rock, shattering the glass.
I winced at the sound, but there was no time to hesitate. He reached inside, quickly unlocking the door. “Get in!” he urged, climbing into the driver’s seat. I scrambled in, my heart racing as Ford started the engine.
“Go, go, go!” I yelled as I glanced in the rearview mirror. We pulled away just as the figures from the estate emerged, their shouts fading in the distance. Ford slammed the gas pedal, and we sped down the road, leaving the chaos behind us. “What now?” I asked, trying to catch my breath.
“First, we need to find a safe place to regroup,” Ford replied, determination etched on his face. “Then we can figure out who’s behind this and why they wanted me gone.” As we drove further away from the estate, a sense of relief washed over me. But deep down, I knew this was just the beginning.
We were still in danger, and the real fight had yet to come. Ford kept his eyes glued to the road, navigating through the winding lanes with a mix of urgency and precision. The trees blurred past us, their shadows stretching across the pavement as we sped away from the looming threat of the estate.
“Where do we go?” I asked, my mind racing with possibilities. “There’s a small town about ten miles from here,” he replied, glancing at me. “We can hide out there for a bit.
I need to contact someone who can help.” “Do you have anyone in mind?” I questioned, the weight of our situation settling heavily on my shoulders. “Yes, a friend from my days in the service.
He’s well-connected and knows how to handle these kinds of situations.” Ford’s expression was resolute, but I could see the tension in his jaw. As we drove, the landscape shifted from dense forests to open fields, the sun shining down on us. It felt surreal, as if we had just escaped from a dark tunnel into the light. But the nagging feeling of being pursued lingered in the back of my mind.
“We should think about what we’re going to tell him,” I said. “We need to explain everything without raising too many questions.” “I know,” Ford replied. “But first, we need to ensure we’re not followed.
I’ll take the back roads into town.” I nodded, appreciating his strategic mindset. The last thing we needed was for our pursuers to catch up to us now. As we continued, the road grew narrower, flanked by tall grass and wildflowers swaying in the gentle breeze. I took a deep breath, trying to calm the chaos swirling in my mind.
“Are you okay?” Ford asked, glancing at me briefly. “I will be,” I assured him. “I just need to process everything.
It’s been a whirlwind.” “We’ll figure this out,” he promised. “Just hold on a little longer.” After a few more twists and turns, we finally approached the outskirts of the town. Small houses dotted the landscape, and the smell of freshly baked bread wafted through the air, a stark contrast to the tension that had enveloped us.
“There’s the diner,” Ford said, pointing to a small, vintage-looking building with a neon sign flickering. “That’s where we’ll meet my friend.” As we parked, my heart raced. I was filled with apprehension, but also a glimmer of hope.
If Ford’s contact could help us, we might just have a chance to get to the bottom of this. “Stay close,” Ford instructed as we stepped out of the car. “We don’t know who’s watching.” We entered the diner, the bell above the door chiming softly.
The cozy interior was filled with the comforting sounds of clinking dishes and quiet conversations. A waitress looked up from behind the counter, giving us a curious glance before returning to her tasks. “Where is he?” Ford muttered under his breath, scanning the room.
“Maybe we should sit at the counter?” I suggested, feeling a bit out of place. “Good idea.” He led the way, and we slid onto two barstools, our eyes still darting around for any sign of danger. After a few moments, a tall man with a weathered face and a friendly smile approached us. “Ford!
It’s been a while,” he said, clapping Ford on the shoulder. “Good to see you, Jake,” Ford replied, relief washing over him. “We need your help.” Jake’s expression shifted to seriousness as he sat down next to us.
“What’s going on?” Ford glanced around the diner, ensuring no one was eavesdropping. “I’m in trouble, Jake. It’s serious. Someone’s after me.” “After you?
Why?” Jake leaned in closer, concern etching his features. “I can’t explain everything right now,” Ford said urgently. “But we need a safe place to stay, and I need to get in touch with some people who can help me sort this out.” “Consider it done,” Jake replied without hesitation. “I have a place nearby where you can lay low for a few days. Just tell me what you need.” As Ford began to explain the situation, I took a moment to observe the diner’s patrons.
Everyone seemed engrossed in their meals, oblivious to the brewing storm outside. I couldn’t help but wonder how many of them had their own secrets and struggles hidden beneath the surface. Once Ford finished his briefing, Jake nodded thoughtfully. “I’ll get us out of here. Follow me.” We slipped out of the diner, the fresh air hitting my face like a splash of cold water. The world felt both familiar and foreign, and I realized just how much had changed in such a short time. “Stay close,” Ford reminded me as we followed Jake to his vehicle parked a few blocks away. Once inside, Jake drove us toward a secluded cabin hidden in the woods.
The drive was quiet, filled with the sounds of tires crunching on gravel and the occasional chirp of birds. I felt a sense of unease creeping in again, but I pushed it aside, focusing on the hope that maybe we could turn things around. When we arrived at the cabin, Jake turned off the engine and looked back at us.
“Welcome to your hideout. You’ll be safe here.” “Thank you,” I said, truly grateful for his kindness. As we stepped out, I took in the surroundings. The cabin was rustic but charming, nestled among the trees with a small stream flowing nearby.
It felt like a sanctuary, a refuge from the chaos of the outside world. “Let’s get inside and discuss our next steps,” Ford said, leading the way. Inside, the cabin was cozy, filled with the scent of wood and the warmth of a crackling fireplace. It felt like a home, a stark contrast to the danger that still loomed over us.
Jake poured us each a glass of water and sat down across from us. “Now, let’s talk about what’s really going on. You mentioned someone’s after you, Ford.
Who?” Ford took a deep breath, gathering his thoughts. “I’m not sure how much you know about my past, but there are things I thought I left behind. It seems they’ve come back to haunt me.” I leaned forward, eager to hear more.
“I was involved in a sensitive operation years ago, one that didn’t end well,” Ford continued. “I thought it was over, but someone seems to have picked up the trail again.” Jake’s expression hardened. “That sounds serious. We’ll need to tread carefully.” As Ford explained further, I felt the weight of our situation settling in.
We were entangled in a web of danger, secrets, and past mistakes. But I also felt a flicker of hope—we had allies now, and together, we might just find a way to uncover the truth and put an end to this nightmare.
As Ford recounted the events that had led him to this point, I could see the tension etched into his features. He was clearly grappling with a mix of fear and determination, the stakes of our situation weighing heavily on his shoulders. “Who knows about this?” Jake asked, his tone serious.
“Anyone else involved in that operation?” “No one I trust,” Ford replied firmly. “I kept things quiet for a reason. The fewer people who know, the safer we are.” “Good thinking,” Jake said, nodding in agreement. “But that also means you need to be cautious.
If they’ve found you once, they can find you again.” I felt a chill run down my spine. The thought of being hunted was terrifying, but it also fueled my resolve. We couldn’t allow fear to dictate our actions. “What do you need from me?” Jake asked, his expression turning serious. Ford hesitated for a moment, then spoke. “I need to figure out who’s behind this. If I can identify the person pulling the strings, we might have a chance to put a stop to it.” “I can help with that,” Jake replied. “I have some contacts who might know something. But we’ll have to be discreet.
We don’t want to attract attention.” “Agreed,” Ford said. “We’ll need to work quickly.” I glanced around the cozy cabin, feeling a strange sense of comfort amidst the uncertainty. Despite the gravity of our situation, this place felt safe, a small haven where we could regroup and strategize. “While we plan,” I suggested, “maybe we should also think about our next moves.
If we’re going to confront whoever’s after you, we need a solid strategy.” “Right,” Ford said, visibly grateful for my input. “Let’s brainstorm. I’ll need to stay one step ahead.” Jake leaned back in his chair, deep in thought.
“What’s the last thing you remember before everything went haywire?” “I was at a meeting with some associates,” Ford explained. “It was supposed to be a routine discussion, but then things started to feel off. I noticed someone was watching me, and not just casually.
It was intense.” “Do you think they were sent to intimidate you?” I asked, trying to piece together the timeline. “It’s possible,” Ford admitted.
“I dismissed it at the time, but looking back, it feels like a warning. They didn’t want me to dig deeper into whatever was going on.” “Then it sounds like you’re already in their crosshairs,” Jake noted.
“You need to get ahead of this. What did you find out before you had to run?” “I learned about some questionable dealings,” Ford said. “There was talk of fraud and smuggling. I think someone wanted me out of the picture to keep their operations hidden.” “Do you have any leads on who it might be?” Jake pressed. “I have a few names, but nothing concrete,” Ford replied.
“I didn’t want to raise any suspicions. But I think if we dig deeper, we might uncover something.” I felt a surge of determination.
“We can start by reaching out to your contacts. Let’s see what they know. If we gather enough information, we can confront them and figure out our next steps.” “Exactly,” Ford agreed. “But we have to be careful. We don’t want to alert them to our plans.” Jake nodded.
“Let’s formulate a plan. I can make a few calls, and we’ll set up some meetings. In the meantime, you two should stay low.” As Jake got up to prepare for his calls, Ford turned to me.
“I appreciate you being here. I don’t know what I’d do without you.” “I’m here for you,” I replied. “We’ll get through this together.” The cabin felt quieter now, the weight of our conversation hanging in the air. I could sense the seriousness of our situation, but there was also a shared commitment between us—a determination to fight back against whatever threat loomed ahead. After Jake finished his calls, he returned with a focused expression. “I’ve set up a meeting with one of my contacts in town. They have information about the dealings Ford mentioned.
We can meet tonight, under the cover of darkness.” “Perfect,” Ford said, his confidence returning. “What time?” “Let’s say around nine. We’ll need to move quickly and quietly,” Jake advised.
I felt a mix of anticipation and anxiety as the plan took shape. Our next steps could change everything, and I hoped we would finally start to unravel the mystery behind the threats against Ford. As night began to fall, the atmosphere in the cabin shifted. Shadows crept along the walls, and the sounds of the forest grew louder, creating an eerie backdrop for our impending meeting. “Let’s get ready,” Ford said, his voice steady.
“We need to be prepared for anything.” With a shared determination, we gathered our belongings, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. The time for action had come, and we were ready to fight back against the darkness that threatened to engulf us. As we stepped outside, the crisp night air wrapped around us like a cloak, heightening our senses.
The moon hung low, casting a silvery glow across the forest, illuminating our path. We moved cautiously, aware of the potential dangers that lurked in the shadows. “Stick close,” Jake whispered as we navigated the winding trail leading to town. “We don’t know who might be watching.” Ford nodded, his expression serious.
“I’ll lead the way. I know a shortcut that will keep us off the main road.” The trees loomed overhead, their branches swaying gently in the breeze. The only sounds were our footsteps and the distant rustle of leaves. I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation; we were stepping into the unknown, but the stakes were too high to turn back now.
As we approached the town, the dim lights of the buildings flickered in the distance. The familiar sights of the streets felt strangely foreign in the darkness. We made our way to a small café that Jake had mentioned, a place known for its discretion. “I’ll go in first and scope the place out,” Jake said. “Stay close to the entrance.
If anything feels off, we’ll regroup and reconsider our approach.” “Understood,” Ford replied, his tone resolute. “Let’s not take any chances.” I watched as Jake slipped through the door, his figure disappearing into the shadows. Ford and I stood near the entrance, our hearts racing with anticipation. The café had an air of mystery, its windows fogged with the warmth of conversation inside.
“Do you think this contact has reliable information?” I asked, breaking the silence. “I trust Jake’s instincts,” Ford replied. “If he believes this person knows something, then it’s worth our time.” After what felt like an eternity, Jake reappeared, a slight nod signaling that all was clear. “We’re good to go,” he said. “Let’s head inside.” The café was dimly lit, the scent of coffee and pastries mingling in the air. We took a corner table, and Jake ordered drinks for us while keeping his voice low.
“The contact is on their way. They should arrive any minute.” “Do you have a plan for what you want to ask?” I inquired, glancing around the room. “Yes,” Ford said, leaning forward. “We need to find out who’s been tailing me and what their motivations are.
If we can connect the dots, we might be able to turn the tables.” Just then, a figure entered the café, scanning the room before locking eyes with Jake. He gestured for the person to join us, and moments later, a woman with an air of confidence slid into the seat across from us. “Jake,” she said, a smirk playing on her lips. “You always know where to find the best company.” “Margaret, good to see you,” Jake replied, a hint of warmth in his tone.
“We need your expertise.” Margaret turned her attention to Ford, her expression shifting to one of curiosity. “So, you’re the one causing all this commotion. I’ve heard whispers about you.” “I need to know who’s behind the threats against me,” Ford stated directly, his gaze unwavering. “I believe there’s a network involved, and I want names.” “Bold,” she replied, leaning back in her chair. “But dangerous.
You don’t know who you’re dealing with.” “Then enlighten me,” Ford urged, his determination palpable. Margaret considered his words, her demeanor shifting as she weighed the risks. “Alright, I’ll tell you what I know. But you need to understand that once you step into this world, there’s no turning back.” Ford nodded, fully aware of the implications.
“I’m prepared for that.” “The person you’re looking for is connected to a larger operation,” she explained, her voice low. “They’ve been in the shadows, manipulating events to their advantage. You’re not just a target; you’re a threat to their plans.” I felt a chill run through me. “What do you mean?” “Your inquiries have drawn attention,” she continued. “And that attention can be lethal. If they think you’re getting too close, they won’t hesitate to silence you.” Jake leaned in, his interest piqued.
“Who is it? Do you have a name?” “Yes,” she said slowly, “but it’s not just one person. It’s a network—powerful individuals who prefer to operate behind the scenes. They use pawns to do their dirty work, keeping their hands clean while they pull the strings.” Ford’s brow furrowed. “Then we need to gather evidence against them.” Margaret nodded.
“That’s where it gets tricky. They’re skilled at covering their tracks. You’ll need more than just suspicion; you’ll need proof.” “Do you have any leads?” I asked, feeling the urgency of our situation intensify. “I might,” she replied, her expression thoughtful.
“But it won’t be easy. You’ll have to infiltrate their circle to gain their trust, and that comes with its own set of dangers.” “I’m willing to do whatever it takes,” Ford insisted, his resolve unwavering. “Then I suggest you prepare yourself for the fight of your life,” Margaret warned. “This won’t be a simple game of cat and mouse. You’re stepping into a world where loyalties shift, and betrayal is common.” As she spoke, I could sense the gravity of our situation.
We were on the brink of uncovering something monumental, but the risks involved were greater than I had anticipated. “I’ll do whatever I can to help,” I said firmly, looking at both Ford and Jake. “We’re in this together.” “Good,” Ford replied, appreciation evident in his eyes.
“We’ll need each other more than ever.” As we sat in that café, the weight of our mission loomed over us, but there was also a flicker of hope. Together, we could navigate the treacherous waters ahead, and perhaps—just perhaps—we could unravel the mystery that had ensnared us all. The atmosphere in the café shifted as the reality of our situation settled in.
Margaret leaned in closer, her voice a whisper tinged with urgency. “If you want to infiltrate their circle, you’ll need a disguise. They’re very cautious about who they let in.
You can’t just walk in and introduce yourselves.” Jake furrowed his brow. “What do you suggest?” “I have a few contacts who might help,” she said, glancing around to ensure no one was listening. “They can provide you with new identities and cover stories. It’ll give you a chance to move undetected.” Ford nodded, processing the information.
“How long will it take?” “Not long,” Margaret assured him. “If we move quickly, I can have everything arranged by tomorrow evening.” “Tomorrow?” I echoed, feeling a mix of apprehension and anticipation. “That’s fast.” “Yes, but it’s also risky,” she replied. “Once you’re in, you’ll have to act convincingly. They’ll be watching every move you make.” “What about you?” Jake asked. “Will you be safe?” “I’ll be fine,” Margaret said with a slight smile.
“I’ve managed to keep myself under the radar for years. But you need to focus on your mission.
This is your chance to turn the tables on them.” “I don’t want to put you in danger,” Ford interjected, concern evident in his tone. “Don’t worry about me,” she insisted. “I’m used to this life.
You, on the other hand, have a target on your back. The sooner you act, the better.” I exchanged glances with Ford and Jake.
The gravity of the situation was becoming all too real, and I could sense the urgency in Margaret’s words. “We’ll do it,” I said, determination rising within me. “We’ll follow your lead.” “Good,” Margaret replied, her expression serious. “I’ll arrange everything and meet you here tomorrow.
In the meantime, stay vigilant. Trust no one, and keep your plans close to your chest.” With that, we finished our drinks and prepared to leave. As we stepped outside, the cool night air enveloped us once more, heightening our senses. I felt a mix of anticipation and anxiety; we were on the precipice of something significant, yet the unknown loomed ahead.
“Let’s get back to the house,” Ford said, his voice steady. “We need to regroup and come up with a plan.” “Agreed,” Jake replied, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any potential threats. “We can’t afford to be careless now.” The walk back to the house felt longer than before, each shadow seeming to loom larger as we passed. I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched, but I pushed the thought aside, focusing instead on the task at hand.
Once inside, we gathered in the living room, the faint light casting long shadows on the walls. Ford paced the room, deep in thought. “We need to establish our cover stories before tomorrow.
We can’t afford any slip-ups.” “I can help with that,” Jake offered. “We should create backstories that align with the network we’re trying to infiltrate.” “Right,” Ford agreed, nodding. “We need to think like them. What do they want?
What do they fear?” I listened intently, taking mental notes as they strategized. “We could pose as investors looking for opportunities,” I suggested. “That might give us a legitimate reason to engage with them.” “Good idea,” Jake said, a grin spreading across his face. “That could open doors for us.” “Let’s not forget to cover our tracks,” Ford added. “We can’t leave any evidence of our real intentions.
If they suspect anything, it could be the end for all of us.” As we continued to brainstorm, I could feel the tension in the room begin to shift. We were no longer just three individuals caught in a web of intrigue; we were a team, united by a common goal. “Tomorrow is crucial,” Ford said, bringing the conversation back to the task at hand.
“We need to remain calm and collected. The slightest hint of uncertainty could ruin everything.” “I’ll keep my eyes open,” I promised. “If I see anything suspicious, I’ll let you know.” With our plans in place, we turned in for the night, each of us retreating to our rooms, the weight of our mission hanging heavily in the air. As I lay in bed, sleep eluded me. My mind raced with thoughts of the day ahead, the potential dangers, and the risks we were about to take. The following morning arrived all too soon, and I felt the excitement coursing through my veins.
We gathered once more in the living room, our disguises ready. I looked at Ford and Jake, both of whom were equally anxious yet determined. “Are we ready?” Ford asked, his eyes scanning the room for any last-minute details.
“Ready as we’ll ever be,” Jake replied, adjusting his collar. “Let’s stick to the plan and keep each other informed.” As we stepped out into the sunlight, I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what lay ahead. Today would be a turning point, a chance to uncover the truth and fight back against those who sought to control us. “Let’s do this,” I said, determination fueling my steps as we made our way toward the unknown.
As we walked through the bustling streets of Paris, the vibrant energy of the city pulsed around us. People hurried past, absorbed in their own lives, unaware of the secrets and dangers lurking just beneath the surface. We navigated through the crowd, each step taking us closer to our destination. “Where exactly are we headed?” I asked, trying to keep the nerves at bay. “Margaret mentioned a club,” Ford replied, glancing at his watch. “It’s frequented by the elite—perfect for gathering intel and finding out more about Ford’s disappearance.” Jake nodded, his expression serious.
“We’ll need to act natural. Blend in with the crowd and don’t draw attention to ourselves.” The club came into view, its entrance adorned with elegant lights that flickered like stars against the evening sky. A doorman stood at the door, assessing each person who approached with a discerning gaze. “Stick to the plan,” Ford reminded us as we approached.
“We’re investors looking to make connections.” I took a deep breath, my heart racing as we stepped closer to the threshold. As we reached the doorman, I felt the weight of his scrutiny, but Ford spoke confidently. “Good evening.
We’re here to meet some associates.” The doorman’s expression softened slightly as he stepped aside, allowing us to pass. The interior was lavish, filled with an eclectic mix of patrons, laughter, and the sound of clinking glasses. The atmosphere was intoxicating, yet I felt the tension bubbling beneath the surface. “Let’s find a spot to observe,” Jake suggested, scanning the room for a strategic vantage point.
We settled at a small table tucked in a corner, where we could see the entire space while remaining inconspicuous. As we settled in, I felt a surge of adrenaline. This was it—the moment we had been preparing for. “I’ll keep an eye out for any familiar faces,” Ford said, his gaze shifting through the crowd.
“We need to identify anyone who might be connected to Ford’s disappearance.” I nodded, my focus drifting to the people around us. Conversations swirled like a dance, snippets of gossip and laughter floating through the air. I leaned in closer to hear. “Did you hear about the latest acquisition?” a woman at the next table exclaimed, her voice filled with excitement.
“It’s going to change everything!” “Absolutely!
And have you seen the new player in town?” her companion replied, eyes gleaming with intrigue. “I’ve heard rumors he’s not to be underestimated.” “Let’s take notes on any names or details that come up,” I whispered to Jake, who was already jotting down observations on a napkin. Minutes passed as we absorbed the atmosphere, our senses heightened.
Then, I spotted a figure across the room—a man in a tailored suit, his demeanor exuding confidence and authority. He was engaged in conversation with a group of well-dressed individuals, his laughter booming above the rest. “That’s him!” I whispered, excitement bubbling within me.
“That’s the man I saw with Margaret before.” Ford and Jake followed my gaze, their expressions shifting to concern. “Do you think he’s involved?” Jake asked, his brow furrowed. “It’s possible,” Ford replied, his tone serious. “We need to approach him carefully.
Let’s see if we can catch him alone.” Just then, the man began to move away from the group, heading towards a quieter area of the club. “Now’s our chance,” I said, adrenaline pumping through my veins. “Let’s go.” We rose from our seats, slipping through the crowd as stealthily as we could.
I felt my heart race as we closed the distance. The man leaned against a wall, looking at his phone, seemingly unaware of our approach. “Excuse me,” Ford said, his voice steady as he stepped forward.
“Can we have a word?” The man looked up, surprise flickering across his features. “And who might you be?” he asked, eyeing us with curiosity. “Investors,” I interjected, keeping my tone light but firm. “We’ve heard some intriguing things about your recent ventures and wanted to discuss potential opportunities.” His expression shifted, curiosity replaced by suspicion.
“I’m not interested in talking business with strangers.” “We can make it worth your while,” Ford said, stepping closer. “We have information that could benefit you. It’s about Ford.” At the mention of the name, the man stiffened.
“What do you know about him?” “Enough to know that he’s not the only player in this game,” Jake added, leaning in. “We have insights that could turn the tide in your favor.” The man regarded us for a long moment, weighing his options. “I’m listening,” he finally said, glancing around as if to ensure we weren’t being overheard.
“Let’s find somewhere more private,” I suggested, nodding toward a secluded booth in the corner. The man hesitated, then nodded. As we moved to the booth, I felt a mix of anxiety and hope. This could be the lead we needed to uncover the truth about Ford’s disappearance.
We settled into the booth, the atmosphere tense with anticipation. “What do you want to know?” the man asked, leaning forward, his interest piqued. “We want to understand what happened to Ford,” Ford replied.
“We know he’s been involved in something bigger than we anticipated.” The man’s eyes narrowed. “That’s not something to take lightly. There are forces at play that you may not fully comprehend.” “Then help us understand,” Jake urged. “We need to know what we’re up against.” The man studied us for a moment, as if deciding whether to trust us. “Alright,” he finally said. “But you must understand the risks involved.
This is not a game.” “We’re aware,” Ford replied, his voice steady. “We’re in this together now.” The man leaned back, crossing his arms as he weighed his words carefully.
“You should know that Ford was mixed up in something dangerous—something that involves more than just business.” “What do you mean?” I asked, my curiosity piqued. “Let’s just say there are people who would go to great lengths to keep certain things under wraps,” he replied, his voice dropping to a whisper. “Ford was onto something that could expose them.” “Expose who?” Jake pressed, urgency in his tone.
“The Black Circle,” the man said, his expression darkening. “A clandestine organization that operates in the shadows of society. They manipulate everything from politics to trade, and they don’t take kindly to those who threaten their interests.” I exchanged glances with Ford and Jake, the gravity of the situation sinking in.
“So, Ford’s disappearance is connected to them?” I asked, trying to connect the dots. “Exactly.
He was investigating them, trying to uncover their operations.
But he got too close, and now they’re trying to silence him,” the man explained.
“If you’re looking for him, you’re not just chasing shadows; you’re stepping into a very dangerous game.” “What can we do?” Ford asked, determination in his voice. “We can’t just sit back and let this happen.” “You need to be careful,” the man warned. “They’re always watching. If you make the wrong move, you could end up like Ford—or worse.” “Then we need to be smart about this,” I said, feeling the weight of our mission. “What’s our next step?” The man took a deep breath, considering his options.
“You need to gather information. Start with the contacts Ford had—he must have left some clues behind. I can help you with that, but you’ll need to be discreet.” “Of course,” Jake nodded.
“We’ll do whatever it takes.” “Meet me tomorrow night at the café on Rue de Rivoli,” the man instructed, his voice firm. “I’ll have more details then. But remember—stay low and keep your eyes open.
The Black Circle has eyes everywhere.” As we left the booth, I felt a mix of excitement and dread. This was a turning point in our investigation, but it came with significant risks. We needed to tread carefully. Outside the club, the cool night air hit us, grounding me in reality.
“What do you think?” Ford asked, glancing at me and Jake. “I think we have a lead, but we need to be prepared for what’s coming,” I replied. “This isn’t just about finding Ford anymore; it’s about uncovering a much bigger conspiracy.” “I agree,” Jake said, his brow furrowed in thought.
“We need to get our bearings and think strategically. If the Black Circle is as powerful as he claims, we can’t afford any mistakes.” “Let’s head back to our place,” Ford suggested. “We can regroup and plan our next move.” As we walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched.
Shadows flickered at the edges of my vision, and I kept glancing over my shoulder. The weight of the unknown hung heavily in the air, amplifying the tension among us. Once we reached our apartment, we settled in, the atmosphere thick with anticipation. “What do we know about the Black Circle?” I asked, eager to get started on our research.
“There’s not much publicly available,” Ford replied, pulling out his laptop. “They’re secretive and operate through intermediaries. Most people don’t even realize they exist.” “Let’s start by looking for any articles or news reports that mention them,” I suggested, my fingers poised over the keyboard. “Maybe we can uncover something useful.” As we delved into the search, a sense of urgency propelled us forward. The hours slipped away as we pieced together fragments of information, exploring dark web forums and obscure news articles that hinted at the Black Circle’s operations.
“Here,” Jake said, pointing at the screen. “There’s a report about a missing journalist who was investigating the Black Circle. It’s dated two weeks ago.” I leaned closer, reading the details. “This could be connected to Ford. If they’re silencing journalists, they won’t hesitate to eliminate anyone else who gets too close.” “We need to find out what this journalist uncovered,” Ford said, his determination evident.
“There might be a link to Ford’s disappearance.” Just then, a notification pinged on Ford’s laptop. “It’s an email from an unknown sender,” he said, opening it cautiously.
“Is it safe to open?” Jake asked, glancing at the screen warily. “We need to know what it says,” I urged. “It could be important.” Ford clicked to open the email, and we leaned in closer, our hearts racing. The message was short but chilling: “Stop digging or you will regret it.” Silence fell over us as we processed the threat. “They know we’re onto them,” Jake said, his voice tense. “Then we need to act fast,” Ford replied, determination igniting in his eyes. “We can’t back down now.
We have to find Ford and expose the Black Circle for what they are.” “Agreed,” I said, feeling a surge of resolve. “We’re in this together, no matter the risks.” As we sat in the dimly lit room, the weight of the email loomed over us. The message felt like a dark cloud, thick with the threat that loomed closer. I could see the determination in my friends’ eyes, and I knew we couldn’t back down.
“Let’s figure out our next steps,” I said, trying to sound calm despite the tension in my voice. “We need to gather as much intel as we can before we make a move.” “I can try to trace the email’s origin,” Ford suggested, his fingers already tapping away at the keyboard. “If we can find out who sent this, it might give us a lead.” “Good idea,” Jake replied, pacing the small space as he considered our options. “In the meantime, I’ll reach out to some of my contacts in the city. Maybe someone has heard something about the Black Circle or knows where we can find that missing journalist.” “Be careful, Jake,” I warned.
“If the Black Circle is watching, they might be keeping tabs on everyone involved. We can’t afford to raise any suspicions.” “I know, I’ll be discreet,” he assured us, his voice steady despite the seriousness of the situation. While Jake made calls, I focused on keeping track of the information we had gathered so far about Ford's disappearance and the Black Circle. The urgency of our task propelled me to work quickly, pulling up articles, notes, and threads from the dark web that hinted at the organization’s activities.
“Got it!” Ford suddenly exclaimed, breaking the tense silence. “I found a source for the email. It originated from a VPN in a café nearby. They might have more information.” “Then we need to check it out,” I said, my heart racing at the prospect of a new lead. “We can’t let this opportunity slip away.” “I’ll come with you,” Jake said, grabbing his jacket. “We should stick together. The last thing we need is to split up right now.” As we prepared to leave, a knock echoed through the apartment, halting our movements.
We exchanged glances, apprehension rising. “Who could that be?” I whispered. “Stay quiet and let me handle this,” Ford said, moving toward the door cautiously.
He peered through the peephole, his expression growing tense. “Who is it?” I asked, keeping my voice low. “It’s Jackson,” he replied, his tone grave. “He’s one of Ford’s old servants.
I don’t know if we can trust him, but he could have useful information.” “Let’s hear what he has to say,” I suggested. “But keep your guard up.” Ford opened the door a crack, revealing Jackson standing there, looking anxious. “I need to talk to you. It’s urgent,” he said, glancing over his shoulder as if expecting someone to follow him. “Come in,” Ford said, stepping aside to let him enter.
Jackson quickly closed the door behind him. “I overheard something you should know. The Black Circle is planning to move against you.
They know you’re looking for Ford.” “What do you mean?” I asked, the realization sinking in. “How did they find out?” “There are spies everywhere. They’ve got eyes on you. You need to be extremely careful,” Jackson warned, his voice low and serious.
“I’m here to help, but we have to be discreet. If they catch wind of me talking to you, it could put us all in danger.” “Why should we trust you?” Jake challenged, crossing his arms defensively. “Because I’ve been loyal to the family for years, and I want to help find Ford,” Jackson replied, earnestness etched on his face.
“I can provide information about the Black Circle’s operations from my time in the house. But you need to act fast.” “What do you know?” Ford asked, urgency lacing his words. “They have a meeting scheduled at a warehouse on the outskirts of town tomorrow night,” Jackson revealed.
“That’s where they’ll discuss their plans for Ford and anyone else who poses a threat to them.” “Do you have a way to get us in?” I asked, adrenaline coursing through my veins. “I can get you inside,” Jackson said, nodding.
“But we need to plan carefully. If we’re caught, it’ll be the end for all of us.” I turned to Ford and Jake, their expressions reflecting my own determination. “This could be our chance to not only find Ford but to gather evidence against the Black Circle.” “Let’s do it,” Ford said resolutely.
“We can’t waste this opportunity.” Jackson outlined a plan for us, detailing how we could slip into the warehouse under the guise of delivering supplies. The more he spoke, the more I felt the weight of the risks we were about to take.
“Are we ready for this?” Jake asked, his voice steady but carrying an undercurrent of concern. “We don’t have a choice,” I replied, feeling the adrenaline surge. “We’re going to find Ford and bring down the Black Circle, no matter the cost.” As we finalized our plan, the gravity of our mission hung over us like a storm cloud, but determination burned in our hearts. We would face whatever came next together, fighting for truth, justice, and our friend.
The following day dawned with a mix of anticipation and dread. We spent the morning gathering supplies and reviewing our plan, each of us acutely aware of the dangers that lay ahead. Jackson was our guide, his familiarity with the area crucial to our success.
As night fell, we donned dark clothing and equipped ourselves with flashlights and walkie-talkies. Jackson led us to a secluded alleyway behind the warehouse, where we could observe the entrance without being seen. “Alright,” Jackson whispered, his voice barely audible over the distant sounds of the city. “This is our best chance to slip in unnoticed.
Wait for the guard to turn his back, then we’ll make our move.” We huddled behind a stack of crates, hearts pounding. The flickering streetlights cast long shadows, and every sound seemed amplified in the silence.
I glanced at Ford and Jake, their expressions a mix of determination and anxiety. “Remember, stay close and stay quiet,” I reminded them, my own nerves tightening as I focused on the entrance. Minutes felt like hours as we waited for the right moment.
Finally, a shadowy figure emerged from the warehouse, the guard yawning and stretching as he stepped away from the door. “Now!” Jackson hissed. We moved swiftly, slipping through the door before it could close fully. Inside, the warehouse was dimly lit, filled with crates and barrels stacked high.
The air was thick with dust and the scent of something metallic. “Where do we go?” Jake whispered, scanning the vast space. “Follow me,” Jackson said, leading us deeper into the warehouse.
“We need to find the meeting room. It should be toward the back.” As we crept through the shadows, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched. My instincts screamed at me to hurry, but we had to move cautiously to avoid detection. We reached a doorway that led to a small office area, the faint sound of voices drifting from behind it. Jackson pressed his ear against the door, listening intently.
“There are at least three men in there,” he said quietly. “They’re talking about Ford. We need to get closer.” I nodded, my heart racing. “Let’s find a way to eavesdrop.” We moved to a side window, peering through the dirty glass. Inside, a group of men sat around a table, papers strewn before them.
They looked serious, their expressions tense as they discussed their plans. “Ford will be dealt with tonight,” one of them said, his tone cold. “He knows too much. We can’t let him slip through our fingers again.” “Agreed,” another man replied. “We’ll need to make an example of him to discourage anyone else from snooping around.” I felt a chill run down my spine. “We have to stop this,” I whispered urgently. Jackson nodded, his jaw set. “We need to find a way to rescue him before it’s too late.” Suddenly, a loud crash echoed through the warehouse, causing us to jump.
The guard outside had tripped over a pile of crates, his shout drawing attention from the men inside. “What was that?” one of them said, standing up from the table. We quickly ducked out of sight, pressing ourselves against the wall. The door swung open, and the guard rushed inside, his face a mask of confusion.
“What’s going on?” he asked, glancing around the room. “Nothing.
Just stay alert,” the man at the table replied, his voice tense. “We can’t afford any mistakes tonight.” We held our breath, hearts pounding in our ears, as the guard stepped back outside.
I exchanged worried glances with Ford and Jake; we couldn’t let this opportunity slip away. Once the coast was clear, we decided to regroup and strategize. “We need a distraction,” I said. “Something to draw them out of the meeting room.” “I can create a diversion,” Jackson offered. “If I can knock over some crates on the other side of the warehouse, it’ll give you a chance to move in.” “Good idea,” Ford said.
“Just make sure you’re safe.” “Don’t worry about me,” Jackson assured us. “I’ll get your friend back.” With our plan in place, we waited for Jackson to position himself.
He crept away, moving silently through the shadows. I could feel the tension mounting as we prepared for what was to come. After a few moments, a loud crash erupted from the opposite side of the warehouse, followed by shouts from the men in the meeting room.
“Go!” I urged, pushing Ford and Jake forward. We darted toward the door, slipping inside just as the men rushed out to investigate the noise. Inside the room, a single light illuminated a cluttered desk and a locked cabinet. “Ford might be in there,” I said, rushing to the cabinet.
“Let’s see if I can get it open,” Jake replied, working quickly to pick the lock. As he fiddled with the lock, I kept an eye on the door, listening for any signs of the men returning. The tension in the air was palpable, every second feeling like an eternity. “Almost got it…” Jake muttered, his brow furrowed in concentration. Just then, footsteps echoed in the hallway, approaching fast.
“Come on, Jake!” I urged, panic rising. With a final click, the lock gave way, and the cabinet door swung open. Inside, I gasped at the sight before us—documents, photos, and a few personal items.
“Is Ford here?” I asked, my heart racing. Jake rifled through the contents, shaking his head. “No, but this is evidence!
We can’t leave it behind!” “Grab what you can, but hurry!” I insisted, my voice tight with urgency. As we gathered the papers, the footsteps grew louder, and I knew we had only moments before they discovered us. “Let’s go!” I said, shoving the papers into my bag as we made our way toward the exit. We slipped out of the room just as the door burst open, the men returning to find the chaos Jackson had created. We darted through the shadows, our hearts pounding as we navigated the maze of crates and barrels.
“We need to find Jackson and get out of here!” I shouted. As we reached the exit, a shout rang out behind us. “Stop them!” one of the men yelled.
Adrenaline surged through me as we raced toward freedom, our only thought to escape the clutches of the Black Circle. As we burst through the exit, the cool night air hit us like a wave. We sprinted across the lawn, adrenaline pumping through our veins.
The sounds of shouts and footsteps followed us, urging us to run faster. “Over there!” Ford pointed to a cluster of trees at the edge of the property. “We can hide there until they calm down!” We veered toward the trees, ducking behind the thick trunks just as the men from the warehouse spilled out into the open, scanning the area for any signs of us.
“Where did they go?” one of them barked, frustration lacing his voice. “I saw them heading toward the tree line!” another shouted, gesturing wildly.
“We can’t let them escape!” I held my breath, pressing against the rough bark, heart racing as the men fanned out, searching the darkness. “Jackson!” I whispered, hoping he had managed to evade capture as well. “Do you think he got away?” Jake asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
“I hope so,” I replied, peering through the leaves. “He was our best chance to find Ford.” A tense silence enveloped us as we listened to the men’s footsteps crunching on the ground nearby.
They were closing in, and we had to act quickly. Suddenly, the sound of distant sirens pierced the night, growing louder as they approached. “Police!” one of the men exclaimed, panic evident in his tone. “We need to get out of here!” “Now’s our chance!” I urged, pulling Ford and Jake to their feet.
“We have to make a run for it while they’re distracted.” We dashed through the trees, our breaths coming in ragged gasps as we sprinted toward the nearby road. The sirens continued to wail, adding urgency to our escape.
As we reached the edge of the property, I glanced back at the warehouse, the flickering lights now punctuated by the flashing blue and red of police cars arriving.
“Keep moving!” I shouted, urging them forward. We crossed the road and ducked into a narrow alleyway, putting as much distance between us and the chaos behind. “Do you think Jackson made it?” Jake asked, his worry evident. “I don’t know,” I admitted, feeling a pang of anxiety for our friend. “But we can’t stop now. We need to regroup and figure out our next move.” We hurried through the maze of streets, sticking to the shadows and avoiding the main thoroughfares.
The city felt alive around us, the sounds of nightlife echoing in the distance. Finally, we reached a small café that was still open, its neon lights glowing warmly against the night. “Let’s go in here,” Ford suggested, glancing around nervously.
“We can catch our breath and come up with a plan.” Inside, the café was quiet, with only a few patrons scattered about. We found a secluded booth in the corner and slid into the seats, our bodies still trembling from the adrenaline. “Okay,” I said, taking a deep breath to steady my racing heart.
“We need to figure out how to find Jackson and what to do next.” “Do you think he went to the police?” Ford asked. “I hope so,” I replied, rubbing my temples. “But we can’t rely on that. We need to find a way to gather evidence against the Black Circle. If we can prove what they’re doing, we might be able to stop them for good.” Jake nodded, his eyes narrowing in thought. “We should check in with some of our contacts. They might know where Jackson is or how to get more information about Ford’s situation.” “Good idea,” I agreed. “Let’s split up and meet back here in an hour. We can compare notes and come up with a solid plan.” As we prepared to leave, a familiar face entered the café.
Jackson stood by the door, looking a bit disheveled but relieved to see us. “Jackson!” I called, rushing to him. “We thought you were caught!” He shook his head, a weary smile spreading across his face. “I managed to slip away just in time.
I saw the police arrive and knew it was now or never.” “Thank goodness,” Ford said, visibly relaxing. “We need to figure out our next steps together.” Jackson nodded, joining us at the booth. “I overheard them talking about a meeting they’re having tonight.
If we can get in there, we might find out more about their plans and Ford’s whereabouts.” “Do you know where it is?” I asked, my heart racing at the prospect of gathering crucial intel. “Yeah,” Jackson replied.
“It’s at an old warehouse by the docks. But we’ll need to be careful.
The Black Circle won’t take kindly to intruders.” We spent the next few minutes plotting our approach. Jackson filled us in on everything he had overheard, and we formulated a plan to infiltrate the meeting.
With renewed determination, we left the café, ready to face whatever dangers awaited us. The night was still young, and the stakes were higher than ever. As we approached the docks, the faint sounds of laughter and clinking glasses filtered through the air, mixing with the salty breeze. The old warehouse loomed ahead, its dark silhouette stark against the moonlit sky. “Remember, we need to stick together,” I whispered as we crept closer.
“If anything goes wrong, we regroup and get out.” Jackson nodded, glancing at Ford, who was trying to steady his breathing. “You ready for this?” Ford squared his shoulders, determination flashing in his eyes. “I’ve come too far to back down now.
Let’s do this.” We moved quietly around the back of the warehouse, where a small, dimly lit door was slightly ajar. The sounds of the gathering inside were louder now, punctuated by occasional bursts of laughter.
“Here goes nothing,” I muttered, pushing the door open slowly. It creaked ominously as we slipped inside, the scent of stale beer and smoke filling our nostrils. The interior was dimly lit, shadows dancing on the walls as we stepped cautiously into the main room. A long table was set up in the center, with several men gathered around it, their faces obscured by the low light.
“Stay low,” I instructed, as we positioned ourselves behind some crates near the back wall. From our vantage point, we could hear snippets of conversation, the tone serious and urgent. “Ford is a liability,” one man said, his voice low and gravelly. “We need to deal with him before he talks.” “What do you propose?” another replied, a sneer evident in his voice. “We can’t just eliminate him; it would raise too many questions.” “Let him think he’s safe for now. It’ll make it easier to trap him later,” the first man suggested.
“And keep an eye on his friends. They’re too close.” My heart raced as I exchanged glances with Jackson and Ford. They were talking about us, plotting against us. We needed to gather evidence quickly.
“Look for anything that might give us a lead,” I whispered. “Documents, plans, anything.” We began to search the area quietly, moving between crates and avoiding the gathering. I spotted a file cabinet in the corner, its drawers slightly ajar. “Cover me,” I said to Jackson, who nodded, keeping an eye on the table.
I slipped over to the cabinet, my heart pounding as I pulled open the top drawer. Inside were folders filled with documents, but one caught my attention immediately. It was labeled “Operation Blackout.” Quickly, I flipped through the pages, my eyes widening as I read about plans involving sabotage and espionage, targeting influential figures in the city. This was bigger than we thought.
“Hey, I need backup!” I whispered urgently to Jackson, who rushed over just as the men at the table began to stand, signaling they were about to leave. “Get that document!” he urged.
I quickly shoved the folder into my jacket, heart racing as I backed away from the cabinet. We had to move fast. “Now what?” Ford asked, anxiety etched on his face. “We need to find a way out before they notice we’re here,” I said, scanning the room for an exit. Suddenly, a loud crash echoed through the warehouse.
The men turned, startled, as one of the crates toppled over, sending contents spilling across the floor. “Did you hear that?” one of them said, suspicion creeping into his voice. “We’ve been compromised!” another yelled, grabbing a nearby chair as he scanned the shadows. “Run!” I shouted, adrenaline surging through me as we darted toward the back door we had entered. We sprinted through the darkness, the sounds of shouting and footsteps following us as we pushed outside into the night. “Go!
Go!” Jackson urged as we dashed around the side of the building. “We can’t let them catch us!” Ford gasped, determination fueling his strides. As we reached the edge of the property, I glanced back to see the men spilling out of the warehouse, their faces twisted with anger.
“Quick!
Into the alley!” I shouted, veering sharply to the right. We sprinted down the narrow path, the sound of our footsteps echoing in the silence. The alley led us further away from the chaos, and I could feel the cool night air against my skin, but we couldn’t stop yet.
“We need to get to a safe place,” I panted. “Somewhere they can’t find us.” “Let’s head to the old church,” Jackson suggested, pointing ahead. “It’s secluded, and we can hide there until we figure out our next move.” “Good idea,” I replied, nodding.
We pushed ourselves harder, our breaths coming in ragged gasps as we reached the old church, its doors slightly ajar. Inside, the air was still, and the faint smell of incense lingered in the corners. We hurried to the back, crouching behind the pews to catch our breath. “Did we lose them?” Ford asked, peering cautiously around a pew.
“I think so,” Jackson replied, glancing at the door. “But we need to stay quiet and lay low for a while.” I pulled out the folder from my jacket, spreading it open on the dusty surface of the pew.
“Look at this. We need to figure out what they’re planning.” The three of us leaned in, eyes scanning the pages as the gravity of the situation settled over us. We had stumbled onto something dangerous, and we needed to act quickly. As we pored over the documents, the details began to weave a darker picture. Each page revealed plots and names that sent chills down my spine. They were planning not just sabotage but a full-scale disruption of the city's social order.
“What do we do with this?” Ford whispered, his eyes darting nervously around the church. “If we take it to the authorities, they might not believe us. This is huge.” “True,” Jackson said, tapping his finger against the table.
“But if we don’t act, they’ll get away with it. We can’t let that happen.” I nodded, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on my shoulders. “We need to gather more evidence. This isn’t just about Ford anymore; it’s about stopping whatever they have planned.” Flipping through the folder, I came across a map of the city, with several key locations marked in red. “Look at this,” I said, pointing to the map.
“They’re targeting government buildings, media centers—this is bigger than just Ford.” “Are they planning something for tomorrow?” Jackson asked, squinting at the notations scribbled along the edges. “If we don’t get this information to someone who can act on it, people could get hurt.” “Let’s divide the tasks,” I suggested, trying to stay focused. “Jackson, you and Ford should scout the area, see if you can find out who else is involved. I’ll stay here and try to decipher more of this document.” “Be careful,” Jackson cautioned.
“If they catch us again, we might not be so lucky.” “I will,” I promised, watching as they slipped out of the church quietly, leaving me alone with the documents. The quiet of the building enveloped me, and I could hear my heart pounding in the stillness. As I delved deeper into the folder, I began to take notes, jotting down names and locations. It was becoming clear that this was an organized effort, and the people involved were not amateurs. I felt a sense of urgency; the clock was ticking.
Suddenly, I heard footsteps approaching. I quickly shoved the papers back into my jacket and crouched down, holding my breath as the door creaked open. A figure stepped inside, silhouetted against the moonlight.
It was a man dressed in dark clothing, glancing around cautiously. My instincts kicked in. Was this one of them? I edged to the side, trying to stay hidden. The man moved further into the church, seemingly unaware of my presence.
He pulled out a small device, and I realized he was checking something—perhaps a phone or a tablet. I couldn’t stay silent any longer. “What do you want?” I demanded, my voice steady but low. The man spun around, shock registering on his face.
“Who’s there?” “Identify yourself,” I said, stepping into the light. “Are you with them?” “I’m not here to hurt you,” he replied quickly, holding up his hands. “I’m just looking for information.
I heard about the plans, and I want to stop them as much as you do.” “Prove it,” I challenged, narrowing my eyes. “What do you know?” “The operation is set for tomorrow night,” he said, glancing nervously at the door. “They’re planning to disrupt the city’s power grid. If they succeed, chaos will follow.” “Why should I trust you?” I pressed, feeling a mix of skepticism and curiosity. “Because I used to work for them,” he admitted, lowering his voice. “But I realized how dangerous they are. I want to help you stop this.” I considered his words carefully. If he was telling the truth, he could be a valuable ally. “What’s your name?” “Oliver,” he replied. “I can help you get more information, but we need to move quickly. They’ll be suspicious if I don’t report back soon.” “Alright, Oliver,” I said, deciding to take the risk. “We’ll work together. But if you betray us, I won’t hesitate to expose you.” “I understand,” he nodded, urgency in his voice.
“What’s the plan?” “I have a map with the target locations,” I said, pulling it back out. “We need to figure out the best way to gather evidence and alert the authorities before it’s too late.” Oliver studied the map, pointing out potential areas for surveillance.
“If we can get a visual of their operations, we can document everything. We’ll need to move fast and quietly.” “Let’s get going,” I replied, adrenaline surging through me. “Every second counts.” We slipped out of the church together, the night cloaking us as we ventured toward the heart of the city’s conspiracy. With Oliver’s insider knowledge and my determination, we stood a chance of unraveling their plans before it was too late. As we moved cautiously through the streets, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were being watched.
Shadows flickered in my peripheral vision, and every sound seemed amplified in the silence of the night. Oliver led the way, his familiarity with the area evident as we navigated alleyways and side streets. The map provided a sense of direction, but the weight of uncertainty hung heavily over us.
“Where are we heading?” I whispered as we ducked into another narrow passage. “There’s a meeting point nearby,” Oliver replied, glancing back at me. “If we can get there before they arrive, we might overhear something crucial.” The anticipation built as we quickened our pace, adrenaline driving us forward. But as we approached the meeting point, I sensed a shift in the atmosphere—a prickling awareness that something was wrong.
“Stop,” I whispered, holding up a hand. “I think we’re not alone.” Oliver nodded, his eyes scanning the darkness. Just then, a group of figures emerged from the shadows, their voices low and urgent. “This is it,” one of them said.
“We need to finalize our plans before the authorities catch wind of what we’re doing.” “We can’t wait any longer,” another replied. “We have to act fast.” I exchanged a glance with Oliver. This was our chance to gather the evidence we needed. “Let’s move closer,” I suggested, inching forward cautiously. We crept up to a hidden vantage point, and I pulled out my phone, ready to record.
The men gathered around a makeshift table, papers and maps strewn about as they discussed their nefarious plans. “Tomorrow night, we initiate Operation Blackout,” one man declared, slamming his fist on the table. “No one will see it coming.” My heart raced as I captured their words, each one solidifying the threat they posed to the city.
“Are we sure we can trust him?” another man asked, glancing nervously at the others. “Ford won’t talk if we keep him quiet,” the first man replied. “We just need to make sure our alibis are solid.” As they continued to speak, I couldn’t help but feel a surge of hope.
We were on the verge of exposing them. But I knew we had to be careful; one wrong move could put us in danger.
Oliver nudged me, his eyes wide with excitement. “We have to get this to the authorities.” I nodded, determination fueling my actions. “Let’s get out of here and plan our next steps.” As we carefully backed away, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were walking into something much larger than ourselves. The stakes were high, and the clock was ticking down. But together, we were determined to uncover the truth and stop whatever dark plans they had in store.
We slipped silently back through the narrow alleyways, our hearts pounding as we replayed the conversation we had just overheard. Each word echoed in my mind, solidifying the urgency of our mission. “Did you get everything?” Oliver asked, his voice barely above a whisper. “Most of it,” I replied, pulling my phone from my pocket to check the recording. “We have the details on Operation Blackout.
Now we just need to get it to the authorities before it’s too late.” “But we can’t just walk in there without proof,” Oliver cautioned. “They’ll need something tangible, evidence that connects the dots.” “True,” I said, realizing the depth of our task. “We should head to the meeting point again. If we can catch them discussing the operation, or even get a visual of their plan, that would be enough to convince the police.” We moved quickly, the city’s shadows growing longer as the night deepened. Each footstep felt heavy with the weight of our mission. As we neared the site of the meeting, I noticed something off.
The streets were unusually quiet, and I caught a glimpse of figures moving in the darkness ahead. “Stay low,” I whispered to Oliver, instinctively pressing myself against a nearby wall as we observed the scene unfolding. Three men stood in a huddle, their faces obscured by the night. I strained to hear their conversation.
“We need to hurry,” one of them said, his voice tense. “The longer we wait, the more chance Ford has to escape.” “Didn’t we send someone to keep an eye on him?” another questioned, glancing around nervously. “We can’t afford to let him slip through our fingers.” “I thought he was secured,” the first man snapped.
“If he gets loose, he could ruin everything we’ve planned.” I exchanged worried glances with Oliver. They were panicking, which meant their plans were fragile.
“We should act now,” I said quietly. “We can’t wait for them to regroup.” “Right,” Oliver replied, determination flooding his eyes. “Let’s get closer and see if we can capture more information.” We crept closer, the tension thick in the air.
I could see the outlines of their faces, their expressions betraying the high stakes of their plot. Suddenly, a loud noise rang out, shattering the quiet night. A loud crash echoed from nearby, followed by shouts.
The men quickly dispersed, vanishing into the shadows as chaos erupted. “What was that?” Oliver exclaimed, glancing around. “I don’t know, but it could be our chance,” I said, adrenaline coursing through me. “Let’s see what’s happening.” We ran toward the source of the noise, navigating through the dimly lit streets.
As we approached, we saw a group of people gathered around a commotion. In the center was a car with its hood open, and a man was frantically waving his arms, trying to get help. “What’s going on?” I asked someone in the crowd. “Somebody tried to steal the car! I think they’re inside!” the bystander shouted, pointing to the vehicle.
My heart raced as I thought of the potential connection. If the conspirators were involved in something as reckless as this, it could provide the distraction we needed to slip away unnoticed. “Let’s use this to our advantage,” I told Oliver. “We need to find out if any of them are still nearby.” We pushed our way through the crowd, glancing around for any sign of the men we had seen before. I spotted one of them, a familiar figure slipping through a side alley. “There!” I whispered to Oliver.
“Let’s follow him.” We trailed behind, keeping a safe distance. The man moved quickly, darting into another alley. I gestured for Oliver to stay quiet as we rounded the corner. The man stopped abruptly, speaking into a phone.
“Yes, we have a problem. The plan is compromised. We need to secure Ford before anything else happens.” I leaned closer to Oliver, my breath quickening.
“We can’t let him get away.” “I’ll distract him,” Oliver whispered, looking around for something to use. He spotted a nearby dumpster and gave me a nod. Before I could protest, he grabbed a rock and tossed it into the dumpster, creating a loud clang.
The man turned sharply, startled, and began moving toward the noise. “Now!” I hissed, and we dashed forward, seizing the moment. The man’s back was turned, and we moved quickly, taking him by surprise. I grabbed his arm while Oliver secured the other.
“What do you want?” the man hissed, struggling against our grip. “Let me go!” “Not a chance,” I replied, my heart racing.
“We know about your plans. Who else is involved?” “I’m not telling you anything!” he spat, but I could see fear creeping into his eyes.
“We’ll make sure you do,” Oliver said, his voice steady. “You’re in way over your head, and we can expose everything.” “Do you really think you can intimidate me?” he sneered.
“You have no idea what you’re dealing with.” “Try us,” I challenged, feeling the adrenaline surge through me. “We already overheard your friends talking about Ford. We’re not leaving until we get answers.” After a moment, the man’s demeanor shifted. “Fine,” he said reluctantly, his bravado faltering. “But you need to understand the risk you’re taking.
They won’t hesitate to eliminate anyone who gets in their way.” “Who are they?” I pressed, tightening my grip. “Just let me go, and I’ll tell you what I know,” he replied, desperation in his voice. “Tell us everything first,” Oliver insisted.
“Then we’ll consider letting you walk.” The man hesitated, weighing his options. Finally, he sighed, defeated. “Alright, alright.
I’ll talk. But you need to promise me protection.” I glanced at Oliver, silently agreeing to hear him out.
“We’ll figure something out. Just start talking.” He took a deep breath. “There’s a group behind all this—a powerful syndicate.
They’ve been planning this for months, and Ford’s just one of their pawns. They’re using him to leverage their power, and they’re willing to do whatever it takes to maintain control.” “Who leads this syndicate?” I asked, pushing for more information. “His name is Victor. He’s been in the shadows for years, pulling strings and manipulating people. He’s ruthless,” the man explained, fear evident in his voice.
I felt a chill run down my spine. This was getting deeper than I had anticipated. “And where can we find him?” “He won’t be easy to reach,” the man warned. “He’s always surrounded by bodyguards, and his operations are well hidden. But if you want to get to Ford, you’ll need to confront him.” “Where’s Ford now?” I pressed, wanting to know how much time we had.
“They’ve moved him to a secure location—somewhere in the old warehouse district. That’s all I know,” he said, looking more nervous by the second. “You need to hurry before it’s too late.” I nodded, feeling the urgency flood back in. “Thank you for your help.
We’ll make sure you get out safely.” As I released him, he scrambled to his feet and disappeared into the shadows, leaving Oliver and me standing in the dim alley. “What do we do now?” Oliver asked, his expression a mix of excitement and fear. “We head to the warehouse district,” I replied, determination surging within me.
“We’re not letting Ford down. Not now.” Together, we set off into the night, ready to confront the syndicate and uncover the truth. The stakes were higher than ever, but we were driven by the knowledge that we were not just fighting for ourselves but for the safety of the entire city. As we approached the warehouse district, the air grew thicker with tension.
Shadows loomed over the dilapidated buildings, and the sounds of the city faded into an eerie silence. “Do you think we should call for backup?” Oliver suggested, glancing nervously at the surrounding darkness. “Not yet,” I replied, my focus narrowed. “We need to gather more information before we involve anyone else.
If we alert them, they might move Ford, and we can’t let that happen.” We crept through the maze of warehouses, our footsteps muffled by the ground beneath us. The atmosphere felt charged, every creak and rustle amplifying the tension in the air. “There,” I whispered, pointing to a building with dim lights flickering inside. “That looks promising.” As we moved closer, I could make out voices from within. I crouched low, trying to catch snippets of the conversation.
“We need to make sure everything goes according to plan,” a voice commanded. “Ford’s arrival is crucial for our next move.” “What if he doesn’t cooperate?” another replied. “He’s been known to resist.” “Then we’ll make him,” the first voice replied coldly. “No one defies us.” My heart raced. They were talking about Ford, and we were running out of time.
“Let’s move in,” I whispered to Oliver, signaling for him to follow me. We edged closer to the entrance, where two guards stood watch. I could feel the adrenaline coursing through me. This was it.
“What’s the plan?” Oliver asked, his voice low. “We’ll have to take them out quietly,” I replied, scanning the area for anything we could use. “On three,” I said, counting down.
One.
Two.
Three.
We surged forward, catching the guards off guard. With swift movements, we incapacitated them, dragging their bodies behind a nearby crate to avoid detection. “Now what?” Oliver asked, his eyes wide with adrenaline. “We get inside,” I replied, pushing the door ajar. The interior was dimly lit, revealing a large room filled with crates and equipment.
The voices we heard earlier were clearer now, echoing from a room at the back. “We need to be careful,” I warned, peering around. “Let’s move slowly.” As we made our way deeper into the warehouse, I could see a group of men gathered, including one I recognized from the earlier encounter. They were discussing Ford, their faces etched with urgency.
“Is he here yet?” one of them asked, glancing toward the door. “Not yet, but he’ll be here soon,” another replied. “We can’t afford to let him slip away.
If he gets wind of what we’re planning…” “Then we need to ensure he doesn’t leave this building alive,” the leader interrupted, his tone icy. I exchanged a worried glance with Oliver. We needed to act quickly before they could finalize their plans.
“Let’s get closer,” I suggested, inching forward to listen in. Suddenly, a loud bang echoed from the entrance, and the group turned, startled. “Did you hear that?” one of them asked, panic in his voice. “Check it out!” the leader barked.
Oliver and I darted behind a stack of crates, hearts racing as footsteps approached. “This is our chance,” I whispered, my mind racing. “We need to find Ford.” As the guards left to investigate, we slipped toward the back room, where I hoped they were holding Ford. The door creaked open, revealing a dimly lit space with shadows dancing on the walls.
“Ford?” I called softly, hoping for a response. “Over here,” a voice replied weakly. I rushed toward the sound, finding Ford tied to a chair, his face bruised but alive. “Thank God you’re here,” he gasped, relief washing over his features.
“I thought I was done for.” “We’re getting you out,” I assured him, quickly working to untie him. “Do you have a plan?” he asked, glancing nervously at the door. “We need to move fast,” I said, cutting the ropes. “There’s a group of men searching for you. We overheard their plans—they won’t let you leave alive if they get their way.” “I’m ready,” he said, determination setting in his eyes as I freed him. “Let’s end this.” Together, we made our way back toward the main room, listening intently for any signs of danger. The voices had risen in volume, and I could tell they were growing agitated. “Something’s wrong,” one of them said.
“We need to regroup and figure this out.” As we moved stealthily through the shadows, we spotted a door leading outside. “There!” I pointed, urging Ford and Oliver to follow. But as we stepped toward the door, it swung open, revealing the leader and several guards, their eyes narrowing as they spotted us.
“Stop right there!” the leader shouted, raising his weapon. I felt time slow as adrenaline surged. “Run!” I shouted, pushing Ford forward. Bullets whizzed past us as we sprinted for the exit, Oliver close behind. “Get to the car!” I yelled, my heart racing as we dashed into the night.
We burst out of the building, the cool air hitting us like a wave. I spotted our car parked nearby and pushed Ford ahead. “Get in!” I urged, glancing back to see the guards spilling out after us. Oliver jumped into the driver’s seat, revving the engine as I dove in beside Ford.
“Go, go!” I shouted, my heart pounding. With a screech of tires, we sped away, leaving the chaos of the warehouse behind. “Did we lose them?” Ford gasped, looking back as the buildings blurred past. “For now,” I replied, trying to catch my breath. “But we need to report everything to the police before they can regroup.” As we drove, the gravity of our actions began to settle in.
We had managed to rescue Ford and escape, but the fight wasn’t over yet. “Where are we heading?” Oliver asked, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. “Anywhere but here,” I replied, my mind racing with plans.
“We need to figure out how to take down Victor and his syndicate once and for all.” The plan began to form in my mind as we sped away. With Ford safe, we could now focus on gathering evidence against the syndicate and exposing them for their crimes. “We need to go to the police,” Ford insisted, looking between us.
“They have to know about Victor.” “Agreed,” I said. “But we need to be careful. If we go in without solid proof, they might not take us seriously.” “Then we gather proof first,” Oliver suggested, his voice steady. “We need to document everything we overheard, and if possible, we should get evidence from the warehouse.” “Good idea,” I replied, feeling a surge of hope. “We’ll go back at dawn when they least expect it.” Ford nodded, determination shining in his eyes.
“Let’s end this before it goes any further.” As the first light of dawn broke over the city, we prepared ourselves for the next phase of our plan. The syndicate had underestimated us, and now it was our turn to turn the tables. The battle was far from over, but we were ready to fight for justice, no matter the cost.
The sun rose, casting a warm glow over the horizon as we set our sights on the next steps to dismantle the syndicate once and for all. As the sun climbed higher, the weight of the task ahead settled heavily on us. Our plan was bold, and the risks were high, but the thought of bringing down Victor and his syndicate filled us with a renewed sense of purpose. We returned to the city, careful to stay out of sight.
Each one of us knew what we had to do, and we had split up to cover more ground. Ford took the task of compiling everything he remembered overhearing, piecing together the conversations he’d been forced to listen to. Oliver and I prepared ourselves for the next step: returning to the warehouse. When night fell, we approached the warehouse under the cover of darkness. The building was quiet, almost too quiet.
We slipped in through a side door and found ourselves in the shadowed corridors, our footsteps silent against the concrete floor. “Look for anything that could help tie Victor to the syndicate,” I whispered to Oliver as we scanned the room. After a few tense moments, we found a locked office near the back of the building.
Oliver quickly picked the lock, and we slipped inside. There, scattered across the desk, were documents, photos, and ledgers—more than we could have hoped for. It was enough to expose the syndicate’s operations.
“Take everything,” I said, shoving files into a bag. “This is the proof we need.” Just as we turned to leave, a noise echoed from the hallway. Footsteps.
“Someone’s coming,” Oliver whispered, his face tense. We ducked behind a stack of crates, our breaths shallow as we listened. A guard walked past, muttering into a radio.
We waited, hearts pounding, until the footsteps faded down the hall. “Let’s get out of here,” Ford whispered as we emerged from our hiding place. We made our way back to the car, adrenaline still pumping.
As we sped away from the warehouse, the relief was overwhelming. We finally had the evidence to bring Victor down. The drive back was silent, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The weight of what we had just done hung in the air. We knew the next step would be critical.
As we reached a safe distance from the warehouse, Oliver pulled over, and we sat there for a moment, catching our breaths. “We did it,” Ford finally said, breaking the silence. “We actually have enough to bring Victor down.” “Let’s not celebrate just yet,” I cautioned, glancing over the documents we had retrieved.
“We still need to get this to the police without alerting Victor’s men.” Oliver nodded, his eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We have to make sure it all counts. If Victor even suspects what we have on him, he’ll disappear before we can do anything.” After a brief discussion, we agreed that it would be safest to deliver the evidence in person, but we couldn’t all go at once.
Leaving the documents with Oliver, Ford and I headed to the police station, planning to relay as much as we could and to set up a meeting for the next day. When we arrived, the officers listened carefully as we recounted what we had uncovered. The chief, a seasoned detective with a hardened expression, seemed skeptical at first, but as we explained the extent of Victor’s operations, his gaze sharpened with interest.
“If what you’re saying is true, this could be the break we’ve been waiting for,” he said, leaning forward. “But you’ll need to bring those documents in tomorrow. Without solid evidence, we can’t move forward.” Ford and I left the station feeling a mix of relief and anxiety. The police were on our side, but there was still a chance that Victor might catch wind of our plan. Back at our safehouse, Oliver was waiting for us. “How did it go?” he asked, handing us both a mug of coffee. “They’re interested,” Ford replied, sitting down with a sigh. “But they need to see the documents tomorrow.” Oliver nodded, then looked at me, his face tense. “Are we prepared for tomorrow?
Once we hand everything over, we’ll have a target on our backs.” I met his gaze and gave a determined nod. “We’ve come this far. We can’t back down now.” We spent the rest of the night planning, going over every detail and ensuring that we were ready for whatever might come our way. The next morning, dawn broke in a wash of grey light. We had barely slept, the anticipation keeping us on edge. With everything packed and the documents secured in a heavy envelope, we prepared to leave for the police station.
“Once we hand this over, there’s no turning back,” I reminded them as we stood at the door. “Victor and his men will know we’re the ones who exposed them.” “We’ve faced worse,” Ford replied, though his eyes betrayed his nerves.
“We’re doing this for all the people who’ve suffered because of him.” Oliver gave a firm nod, clutching the evidence to his chest. “Let’s end this.” The drive to the station was tense, each passing car and every stranger on the street seemed like a potential threat. Paranoia crept in, but we forced ourselves to stay focused. When we finally pulled up to the police station, relief washed over us.
Inside, the same detective from the night before was waiting. He motioned us into his office, shutting the door behind us. “You brought the evidence?” he asked, his tone steady but eager.
Oliver handed over the envelope, and we watched as the detective began sifting through the papers. His eyes widened slightly as he pieced together the damning information—transactions, meeting records, lists of names. “This…this is bigger than we thought,” he murmured, setting the documents down. “With this, we can make arrests. But you need to be careful.
If Victor realizes what’s happening, he won’t hesitate to retaliate.” “We understand,” I replied. “Just make sure it’s enough to bring him down.” The detective nodded.
“We’ll keep you updated, but for now, I’d suggest lying low. My team and I will handle the rest.” We left the station, hearts pounding but hopeful.
It felt as if a weight had been lifted; after all these weeks, we’d finally found a way to fight back against Victor’s syndicate. That night, we returned to our safehouse. The quiet felt surreal after the constant tension we’d been under. But just as we started to relax, my phone buzzed.
I looked down, seeing a message from an unknown number: “Thought you could betray me? You’ll regret it.” My heart stopped as I showed the others. Ford’s face went pale, and Oliver’s fists clenched.
“He knows,” I said, the words barely a whisper. “Victor knows.” The room fell into silence as the gravity of our situation sank in. We’d managed to put a dent in his empire, but now, he was coming after us.
“Pack everything,” Oliver said, his voice calm but urgent. “We need to move, now.” As we scrambled to gather our belongings, the realization hit us—our fight with Victor was far from over. And this time, it was personal. With every passing second, the urgency grew.
We grabbed only the essentials, leaving anything that could slow us down. Outside, the city was quiet, the streetlights casting long shadows as we slipped into the car. “Where do we go now?” Ford asked, his voice tense. “Somewhere he can’t find us,” Oliver replied, starting the engine. “We’ll figure out a plan on the way.” I sat in the backseat, scanning the streets for any signs of Victor’s men. The message he’d sent was a warning, but it wouldn’t be long before he acted on it. As we sped down the darkened streets, a thought struck me.
“We still have a chance to turn the tables,” I said, breaking the silence. “If we can find Victor before he finds us, maybe we can finally end this.” Ford looked over at me, doubtful. “You’re suggesting we go after him?” “We’re already in his sights,” I replied, feeling a surge of determination. “We know his operations.
We know his people. And now, we know his weaknesses.” Oliver nodded slowly, considering the idea. “It’s risky, but maybe that’s our best shot.
If we can dismantle what’s left of his operation, he’ll have nowhere to hide.” We drove out of the city and found a quiet, isolated place to regroup. In the dim light of dawn, we spread out what information we had on Victor’s network, looking for a way to bring him down from within. His operation relied on a few key locations and contacts—people who might be willing to turn on him if the price was right. Ford pointed at a spot on the map, marking one of Victor’s suspected hideouts.
“He’s not going to be there himself, but if we can get to his associates, they might lead us to him.” A few hours later, we were back on the road, heading toward the first location. It was a rundown building in an industrial part of town, where one of Victor’s lieutenants was known to operate. As we approached, Oliver parked a safe distance away, and we moved in on foot, sticking to the shadows. Inside, we found a group of men, deep in conversation around a table littered with papers. As we crept closer, we could hear snippets of their conversation.
They were planning something big, something that sounded like it involved Victor’s retaliation against us. Ford’s face paled as he heard his own name mentioned. “They’re coming after us,” he whispered. Oliver and I exchanged a look.
This was our chance to gather more intel and disrupt their plans. But we’d have to act quickly and carefully if we wanted to get out unscathed.
I took a deep breath and gestured to the others. “Let’s get closer. If we can grab any documents or record their plans, it’ll give us the edge we need.” We edged forward, careful not to make a sound.
As we reached the table, I managed to snap a few photos of the documents lying around. Just as we were about to slip away, one of the men looked up, his eyes narrowing as he spotted us. “Hey!
Who are you?” Without a second thought, we turned and ran. Alarms rang out, and footsteps thundered behind us as we sprinted through the building.
Heart pounding, I barely managed to keep pace with the others as we dodged down corridors and ducked behind crates. Just as we reached the exit, Oliver yanked open the door, and we burst into the open air, racing toward the car. “Go, go, go!” I shouted as we jumped in, and Oliver floored the gas. The tires screeched as we sped away, leaving a cloud of dust behind us. As we finally put distance between us and the building, I looked over at Ford, who was clutching the camera. He gave a shaky nod, and I knew he’d managed to get everything we needed. “Now,” I said, taking a deep breath, “we have the upper hand.” We drove in silence for a while, the tension of the close call still hanging thick in the air. As the streets blurred past, I could feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins, but beneath it lay a creeping anxiety. We had evaded capture this time, but Victor wouldn’t take our interference lightly. “Let’s find a safe spot to lay low,” Oliver suggested, breaking the silence. “We need to review what we got and come up with our next move.” I nodded, my mind racing.
“There’s a cabin I know of, deep in the woods. It’s remote and should keep us off the radar for a bit.” “Lead the way,” Ford said, his voice steadier than before. As we made our way out of the city and into the more desolate areas, the landscape shifted.
The urban sprawl gave way to stretches of trees and quiet roads. After a while, we pulled up to the cabin, nestled among towering pines. It was a modest place, but it had served us well in the past.
We quickly unloaded our gear and stepped inside, the familiar scent of wood and earth welcoming us. Once we settled in, we spread out the documents and images we’d taken. The tension began to ease as we focused on the task at hand. Ford flipped through the pages, his brow furrowed in concentration. “These meetings are happening soon,” he noted, pointing at the highlighted sections.
“If we can infiltrate one, we might catch Victor off guard.” “Yeah,” Oliver replied, leaning closer. “But we need a plan. Just charging in won’t work. We need to gather more intel, figure out the layout, who’s involved, and most importantly, where Victor is hiding.” “Maybe we can pose as buyers,” I suggested, the idea forming in my mind.
“Victor’s operation likely involves some shady deals. If we can convince them we’re interested in joining, we might be able to get close enough to him.” “Risky,” Ford said, shaking his head. “But it might be our best shot. We’d need to get some fake IDs and maybe even backstories.” “I can handle that,” Oliver replied, a determined glint in his eye. “I know a guy who can help us with that. He’s good at creating identities.” I felt a wave of relief wash over me. “Then let’s do it. We can set up a meeting and see how much we can learn before making any moves.” We spent the next few hours crafting our new identities.
With Oliver’s connections, we managed to get convincing documentation that would allow us to slip into Victor’s world. We rehearsed our backstories—Ford would be an eager new recruit, while I’d act as his seasoned partner who had been in the game longer. As night fell, we prepared for our mission. Each of us felt the weight of the stakes we were playing for. This wasn’t just about us anymore; it was about justice for all those who had suffered under Victor’s rule.
The next morning, we set out again, our hearts pounding with a mix of excitement and dread. We drove to the meeting location—a rundown warehouse on the outskirts of town, where we were supposed to meet one of Victor’s lieutenants. The air was thick with anticipation as we approached. “Remember, stick to the plan,” I reminded them.
“We’re here to gather information, not to blow our cover.” We arrived at the warehouse, a grim structure that loomed against the cloudy sky. As we stepped out of the car, the weight of the moment settled on us.
The warehouse was alive with activity—men moved in and out, their faces serious as they carried crates and whispered amongst themselves. We exchanged a final glance before entering. Inside, the atmosphere was tense.
Dim lights hung overhead, casting eerie shadows that flickered with every movement. I could hear the faint sounds of voices from deeper within the building. After a brief moment of confusion, we spotted the lieutenant—a burly man with a scar running down his cheek, sitting at a table surrounded by a few of his associates. He looked up as we approached, sizing us up with an intense gaze.
“Who the hell are you?” he barked, leaning back in his chair. “What do you want?” “We heard you’re looking for new recruits,” I said, adopting a confident demeanor. “We’re interested in joining the operation. Heard you guys are the best in the business.” The lieutenant smirked, exchanging glances with his men. “You think you can just stroll in here and expect us to take you seriously? What do you know about our work?” I felt a surge of adrenaline, knowing I had to play this right.
“We know there’s money to be made and power to be gained. We’ve heard stories about your operations and want in. We’re not afraid of a little risk.” “Yeah, and what’s your angle?” he pressed, narrowing his eyes.
Ford chimed in, “We’re willing to do what it takes. We’ve got skills—just give us a chance to prove ourselves.” The lieutenant’s interest seemed piqued, but suspicion lingered.
“Alright, let’s say I buy your act. We’ll need to test you. Meet me here tomorrow at the same time. I’ll have a job for you.” As we turned to leave, I exchanged a quick glance with Ford and Oliver, silently communicating our relief.
We had made it through the first hurdle. Once we were outside, we quickly regrouped. “We need to make sure we’re prepared for whatever he throws at us,” I said, my heart racing. “Tomorrow is crucial.” “We should stake out the place tonight,” Oliver suggested.
“If we can see who else comes in and out, we might get a better idea of their operations.” “Good idea,” I agreed, and we settled into our car a safe distance away from the warehouse, keeping watch through the darkness. As the night wore on, we witnessed various shady figures entering and leaving, exchanging whispers and nods. Each passing moment intensified the urgency of our mission. Just before dawn, I spotted a familiar face among the group—a man I had seen before during our investigation, someone tied closely to Victor’s operations.
“Look,” I whispered to the others, pointing him out. “If he’s here, it means Victor might be close. We need to be careful.” The weight of what lay ahead settled on us like a thick fog. This wasn’t just a simple meeting anymore; we were entangled in a web of danger, deceit, and potentially deadly confrontations. The next day, we arrived back at the warehouse, anxiety pulsing through us. We walked in, nerves humming as we faced the lieutenant once more. “You ready for your first job?” he asked, his expression unreadable.
“Absolutely,” I replied, my voice steady despite the racing thoughts in my head.
“Good. We’ve got a shipment coming in, and I need you to help unload it. Keep your mouth shut and do as you’re told, and you might just fit in.” As he explained the details, I caught snippets of information about Victor’s operation and its connections to various criminal activities.
My mind raced, knowing this was the moment we had to gather everything we could. Once we finished the unloading, I managed to pull aside one of the workers, casually striking up a conversation. “So, what’s it like working for Victor?” I asked, feigning curiosity.
The worker glanced around nervously before replying, “It’s a job like any other. But you gotta watch your back.
Victor doesn’t like loose ends.” That was the confirmation we needed. Victor was on edge, and with every moment we spent here, we were getting closer to uncovering more about his operation. The day passed in a blur of activity, the adrenaline pushing us forward as we took mental notes of everything we saw. But with every fleeting second, we knew that time was running out.
We had to act before Victor caught on to our true intentions. As the day drew to a close, we made our way back to our car, each of us buzzing with adrenaline. “We need to find a way to use this information,” I said, my mind already racing ahead. “If we can find a way to expose him or disrupt his shipments, we might finally have a chance to take him down.” “Let’s brainstorm tonight,” Oliver suggested, his eyes glinting with determination.
As night enveloped us, we knew the real battle was just beginning. Victor was not just a criminal; he was a mastermind with resources and connections. But with each piece of information we gathered, we felt ourselves inching closer to victory.
Our small victories would soon add up, and as long as we stayed one step ahead, there was still hope. This time, we would fight not just for ourselves but for everyone Victor had harmed. It was time to dismantle his empire, one brick at a time.
Back at the cabin, we gathered around a small table, the dim light illuminating the notes and maps we had spread out before us. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation as we strategized our next steps. “First, we need to analyze everything we’ve seen and heard,” I began, looking at the scattered documents.
“Victor’s operation seems extensive, and if we can pinpoint his supply chain, we can disrupt it.” Ford nodded, his brow furrowed in thought. “We should focus on the shipments we overheard at the warehouse. If we can intercept one, we might get our hands on valuable evidence.” “Agreed,” Oliver chimed in. “We need to find out when the next shipment is scheduled.
We can leverage our new roles to gather intel without raising suspicion.” I leaned forward, excited by the possibilities. “There might be someone inside who can help us. We should identify a potential ally among the workers.
If we can win them over, they could provide us with critical information.” “Smart thinking,” Ford said. “We should also be cautious. Victor is not just a criminal; he’s dangerous. If he senses any betrayal, we could be in serious trouble.” “Let’s do some reconnaissance,” I suggested.
“We’ll head back to the warehouse and observe who interacts with whom. We need to identify anyone who seems discontent or worried about their role in the operation.” As we formulated our plan, I couldn’t shake the feeling of impending danger. Victor was a step ahead of us, and with every second we spent plotting, he could be fortifying his defenses. The next day, we returned to the warehouse, our hearts pounding with anticipation.
We blended in with the other workers, doing our best to appear casual while keeping a close eye on everything around us. As we worked, I noticed a young woman, Mia, who seemed to stand out from the rest. She was sharp-eyed and observant, occasionally exchanging uneasy glances with her colleagues.
It was clear she was not entirely comfortable in her role. “Let’s talk to her,” I whispered to Oliver and Ford as we took a short break. “She might be our best chance at gathering intel.” With a plan in mind, we approached her. “Hey, you’re new around here, right?” I said, trying to sound casual. “We’re just getting the hang of things ourselves.” Mia glanced up, surprise flickering across her face before she nodded. “Yeah, I started recently. It’s… different.” “Different how?” Ford probed, trying to encourage her to open up. She hesitated, looking around to ensure no one was listening. “It’s just that things feel off.
There’s a lot of secrecy, and I’m not sure what I’ve gotten myself into.” “That’s exactly how we feel,” I said, my tone sympathetic. “If you don’t mind me asking, what do you know about Victor?” Her expression hardened slightly.
“Not much. Just that he’s powerful and ruthless. Some people disappear if they don’t follow orders.” The gravity of her words settled over us like a heavy blanket. “You’re right to be cautious,” I replied. “But we’re not here to cause trouble. We want to find a way out of this mess.” Mia’s eyes widened slightly, as if she could sense our resolve. “If you really want to help, you should be careful. Victor doesn’t take kindly to dissenters.” “Can you tell us anything about the next shipment?” Oliver asked, leaning in.
“We might be able to help you and others if we know when it’s coming.” She glanced around again, ensuring we were not being overheard. “I overheard them say something about a big shipment arriving tomorrow night. It’s supposed to be a large delivery of weapons.” “Tomorrow night,” I repeated, my mind racing. “We need to act quickly. If we can intercept it, we might not only get proof but also expose Victor’s operation.” Mia nodded, her expression resolute. “I’ll help you, but we need a solid plan. If we get caught…” “We won’t,” I assured her, trying to instill confidence. “We’ll be careful. The goal is to gather evidence and then get out.” Over the next few hours, we worked closely with Mia, gathering more information about the shipment and its logistics. We learned the location where the delivery would take place and the number of guards expected to be on duty. By the end of the day, we had a rough plan in place. We would intercept the shipment tomorrow night, using our roles as workers to gain access to the area.
If everything went according to plan, we would be able to gather the evidence we needed to take down Victor. As the sun set, we returned to the cabin, a sense of urgency driving us forward. The weight of what lay ahead hung heavily in the air, but there was also a flicker of hope.
This could be our chance to dismantle Victor’s empire once and for all. That night, we prepared for the operation, double-checking our gear and strategizing the details. We would need to be stealthy and quick, ensuring we could gather the evidence without drawing attention to ourselves.
“Let’s meet at the warehouse an hour before the shipment arrives,” I instructed. “We’ll position ourselves where we can see everything without being seen.” “Got it,” Ford said, his expression determined. “We’ll make this work.” The night was thick with anticipation as we finally set out.
The streets were quiet, the city seemingly unaware of the storm that was about to unfold. As we approached the warehouse, I could feel the adrenaline coursing through me. This was it—the moment we had been preparing for. We arrived at the warehouse, the shadows dancing ominously in the dim light. As we entered, I could hear the muffled sounds of conversations and the clinking of metal.
The atmosphere was tense, charged with an energy that hinted at the impending chaos. Mia met us at the designated spot, her face pale but resolute. “I’m ready,” she said, determination shining in her eyes.
“Remember, stick to the plan,” I reminded her. “We gather evidence and get out. No heroics.” As the clock ticked closer to the designated time, we took our positions, our hearts racing in anticipation. The minutes felt like hours as we waited, the tension building with each passing second.
Finally, the rumble of engines broke the silence, and headlights cut through the darkness. The delivery truck arrived, and my pulse quickened as we watched the scene unfold. “Here we go,” I whispered, steeling myself for what was about to happen. As the truck doors swung open, revealing crates stacked high with weapons, we knew this was our chance. We had to act swiftly and decisively.
With the truck doors wide open, I signaled to Oliver and Ford. “Now!
Let’s move!” We crept closer, using the shadows as our cover. The delivery crew was busy unloading the crates, their backs turned to us.
I could hear their muffled chatter, punctuated by the clanking of metal as they moved the cargo. My heart raced with the urgency of the moment. “Stay low and be quiet,” I reminded the team as we approached the rear of the truck, crouching behind a stack of crates for concealment.
The scent of metal and diesel filled the air, a stark reminder of the dangerous game we were playing. Mia peered around the corner, her eyes scanning the area. “Looks like there are only two guards. We might be able to get in and out without them noticing.” “Good,” I said, trying to formulate a plan in my mind.
“We need to gather as much evidence as we can. If we can get photos of the weapons and the shipment records, that’ll be solid proof for the police.” Ford nodded, glancing at me with determination. “Let’s grab the camera and start documenting.” I pulled out the camera, ensuring it was ready to go. We took a deep breath and readied ourselves for the next move.
“On my count, we make our way to the side of the truck, and Mia can cover us while we take the pictures,” I instructed. “Got it,” she replied, her voice barely a whisper. “Three… two… one… go!” We dashed to the side of the truck, careful to stay low. My heart thudded in my chest as I focused on the task at hand. I aimed the camera at the crates, snapping pictures of the markings and the contents.
Each click of the shutter felt like a small victory. “Cover me while I check the paperwork,” Ford said, kneeling down to peer inside the cab of the truck. “If we can get shipping documents, that’ll really help our case.” I kept an eye on the guards, my senses heightened. “Be quick!” I urged, the tension palpable as we worked against the clock.
Suddenly, a loud shout rang out from the entrance of the warehouse. “Hey!
Who’s there?” My blood ran cold. We had been spotted!
“Run!” I shouted, instinctively grabbing Mia’s arm. We sprinted away from the truck, adrenaline surging as we dodged around crates and barrels. The guards yelled behind us, their footsteps pounding on the concrete.
“Stop!
Get back here!” We ducked behind a large stack of boxes, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. “What do we do now?” Oliver asked, panic creeping into his voice.
“Hold on,” I replied, trying to think quickly. “We need to create a diversion. Ford, can you distract them?” Ford nodded, a fierce determination in his eyes. “I’ll do it. Just make sure you guys get away.” “Are you sure?” I asked, but he was already moving, slipping away into the shadows. As Ford drew the guards’ attention, Mia, Oliver, and I made a break for it. “We need to get to the back exit,” I urged, leading the way. We navigated through the maze of crates, our hearts pounding in our chests.
The sound of shouting echoed behind us, growing louder as the guards realized they had been tricked. Just as we reached the back door, I heard a loud crash. “What was that?” Mia asked, wide-eyed. “Ford!” I exclaimed, torn between the urge to help him and the need to escape. “We have to go!” “No!
We can’t leave him!” Oliver shouted, but the sound of approaching footsteps pushed us toward the exit. We pushed through the door, emerging into the cool night air. “This way!” I gestured, leading us down a narrow alley behind the warehouse. The adrenaline kept us moving as we sprinted away, the sounds of the guards fading behind us. We didn’t stop until we reached the cover of the trees nearby.
“What do we do now?” Mia gasped, trying to catch her breath. “We need to regroup and find Ford,” I replied, my mind racing. “He can’t be far behind.
We have to help him.” Just then, a rustling noise came from the direction we’d fled. “Is that you, Ford?” I called out, my heart racing. Emerging from the shadows, Ford appeared, slightly disheveled but otherwise unharmed. “I’m here!
They almost caught me, but I managed to slip away.” “Thank goodness,” I breathed a sigh of relief. “Let’s get out of here before they come looking for us again.” With a renewed sense of purpose, we made our way back to the car, determined to share what we’d learned. As we drove away from the warehouse, I glanced at the evidence we had managed to gather. “We’ve got a lead,” I said, looking at my friends.
“If we can get this information to the police, we might just take down Victor and his operation.” Ford nodded, a fire igniting in his eyes. “Let’s make sure we get it all documented and organized. This is our chance.” As we made our way to the police station, I felt a sense of hope mingling with the fear.
We were in the thick of danger, but we had each other, and we had a plan. The fight for justice was far from over, but we were ready to see it through. As we pulled up to the police station, the weight of our mission settled on us, mingling with a sense of cautious hope.
The late-night air was thick and quiet, and the fluorescent lights overhead cast long shadows across the empty lot. I looked at my friends one more time before we stepped inside, nodding silently. The officer at the front desk raised an eyebrow as we approached.
Ford stepped forward, explaining our story with a calm urgency that made even the hardened officer lean forward, listening intently. One by one, we laid out the photos, maps, and notes we had collected, detailing Victor's operation and the chain of warehouses scattered across the city. As the officers began to review our evidence, a thought struck me.
"We have to be careful," I whispered to my friends. "If Victor finds out we’re working with the police, he’ll come after us." A moment of silence followed, then Ford spoke up, his voice steady. “That’s a risk we’ll have to take.
This is bigger than us.” An officer looked up from our documents, nodding approvingly. "This is solid work," he said. "You may have just given us what we need to move on Victor.
" Relief and fear washed over me simultaneously. We had brought them a lead, but we were still deep in Victor’s crosshairs. As we left the station, I caught my breath, knowing the danger was just beginning.
As we walked out of the police station, the cold night air seemed to cut sharper than before, and every shadow felt a bit darker. There was a gravity to what we’d done, a sense that we were now entangled in something much larger than ourselves. The weight of it settled on each of us differently, but we all felt it. Ford was the first to break the silence as we reached the car. "We’re in this now, all the way," he said, his voice steady but low.
"There’s no backing out.
" He was right. We were in the middle of a game we hadn’t fully understood until now. This wasn’t just about gathering evidence and passing it along. Victor would soon realize that someone was working against him, and when he did, it wouldn’t take him long to trace it back to us. The stakes had escalated, and it was time to confront what that truly meant.
We spent the drive back poring over the details of our plan, speaking in low voices as if even the darkness could hear us. Everything needed to be airtight. Our evidence had to be meticulously documented, organized, and, if possible, duplicated. We couldn’t let a single piece fall through the cracks.
I glanced back at our growing file of notes and pictures, feeling both proud and anxious. This evidence was our weapon, but it also painted a target on our backs. When we reached Ford’s place, we turned his living room into a makeshift headquarters.
Notes and photos were spread across the coffee table, maps pinned to the wall with routes marked in red. The once-cozy space now felt like a war room. As the hours passed, exhaustion set in, but none of us dared to sleep.
Somewhere around three in the morning, I caught Ford staring at a photo of Victor’s main warehouse, the one we’d just left hours ago. His face was tense, his jaw clenched. He hadn’t said much, but I could see something fierce behind his eyes—a fire that hadn’t been there before. “What’s on your mind?” I asked him. He looked at me, his expression unyielding. “This isn’t just about stopping Victor for me,” he said quietly. “It’s about making sure no one else gets hurt by him.
I’ve seen what people like him do—they destroy lives.” His words hung in the air, heavy and raw. Before I could respond, Mia, who had been taking notes on her laptop, spoke up.
“We’re all in this for different reasons, but we’re in it together. We can’t let fear stop us now.” We nodded, a silent pact passing between us. By morning, we’d finalized our next steps. We had planned, prepared, and anticipated as much as possible.
Now, all we could do was move forward and hope our combined strength would be enough. But as dawn broke and light spilled into the room, the reality hit hard: Victor was ruthless, and we were just a few determined people with a file of evidence.
Would that really be enough to bring down someone like him? The question lingered, a quiet dread that none of us dared voice. In the days that followed, things moved fast. We delivered every piece of information to the police, double-checked every fact, every connection. And yet, a strange silence loomed, as if the calm before a storm.
We started to sense a presence, shadowy figures tailing us, cars that seemed to appear just a little too often. Victor’s people had noticed us, and their silent warnings grew louder. One evening, as we were leaving the police station, a black car pulled up beside us. The windows were tinted, hiding the driver’s face. The door creaked open, and a voice I’d only heard in recordings echoed from the darkness inside.
"Enjoying your little investigation?” It was Victor himself. Fear surged through me, but Ford took a step forward, standing his ground. “We’re not afraid of you, Victor.” A dry laugh drifted from the car. “Oh, you will be,” he said smoothly.
“It’s cute that you think you’re brave. But this game is bigger than you.
Much bigger.” With that, the door slammed shut, and the car sped off, leaving us frozen in place. The brief encounter left a chilling mark, a reminder that Victor wasn’t just some faceless adversary. He was a man who enjoyed playing with his prey. Our lives changed after that night. Every sound, every shadow became suspect.
We were hunted, but we refused to be broken. This was our story now, and we would see it through to the end, no matter how dark the path ahead. The fight for justice had only just begun, and we knew we were in for the battle of our lives.
The tension only grew as the days passed, and the threat of Victor’s reach lingered in the back of our minds. We worked tirelessly, piecing together more leads and following every loose end. Ford, Mia, and I took shifts watching each other’s backs, knowing that at any moment, Victor’s men might show up. It felt like we were living on borrowed time.
One night, as we sat huddled in Ford’s dimly lit living room, Mia’s face lit up as she uncovered something important on her laptop. She motioned us over with urgency in her eyes. “I think I found it,” she said, voice barely above a whisper. “Victor has a second location—a safe house. He’s hiding a lot more than we realized.” I leaned over her shoulder, squinting at the screen.
A series of transactions led to a remote, abandoned building just outside the city. It wasn’t on the police’s radar yet. Victor was clever, hiding assets through shell companies and false names, but Mia had managed to unravel his web of secrecy. Ford clenched his fists, his gaze dark. “This might be our chance to get something definitive.
If we can get inside and find anything—documents, recordings, anything—it could be the break we need.” Despite the danger, a thrill of determination pulsed through us. We knew that if we waited for too long, Victor might catch on and move everything. This was a narrow window, and it was closing fast. We agreed: tomorrow night, we’d go to the safe house and find whatever Victor was hiding.
The following evening, we parked a block away from the abandoned building, its silhouette looming like a dark shadow against the night sky. The place was eerie and silent, save for the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. We moved quietly, each step carefully placed as we approached the entrance. Ford led the way, and Mia and I stayed close behind, hearts pounding with anticipation and fear. Once inside, we quickly realized this wasn’t just a safe house; it was a command center.
Maps covered the walls, marked with red circles that showed Victor’s network across the city. There were tables stacked with files, phones, and small surveillance devices. This was Victor’s nerve center, and we were right in the middle of it.
Mia immediately began snapping photos, her hands shaking slightly as she captured everything. Ford rifled through a stack of documents, his eyes widening at the level of detail Victor had on his enemies—and on us. I couldn’t believe it; he’d been watching us from the start, tracking our every move.
Chills ran down my spine as I read my own name on a list labeled “Potential Threats.” We didn’t have much time. Ford loaded a few files into his bag, and I grabbed a folder marked “Confidential.” Just as we were about to leave, the unmistakable sound of footsteps echoed down the hallway.
“Someone’s here,” I whispered, feeling my pulse quicken. We exchanged panicked glances, our hearts pounding in unison. There was no escape; the only way out was back down the narrow hallway we had come through, and the footsteps were getting louder. Ford took a quick look around and spotted a supply closet. He motioned for us to hide inside.
We squeezed into the cramped space, holding our breaths, listening as the footsteps drew closer. Through the thin crack in the door, we saw a figure—a tall man with a familiar, menacing presence. It was one of Victor’s top men, the enforcer we’d only heard rumors about. His face was as cold as his reputation.
He stopped in front of the closet, his gaze sweeping the room suspiciously. I could feel my pulse hammering in my throat, the silence inside the closet deafening. He lingered for a moment, and I felt Mia’s hand grip mine tightly, both of us bracing for the worst.
Then, just as suddenly as he had appeared, he turned and walked down the hall, his footsteps fading into the distance. We waited, each second stretching unbearably, until we were sure he was gone. Ford exhaled quietly, nodding to us. “Let’s move. Now.” We slipped out of the building and made our way back to the car, clutching our precious evidence as if our lives depended on it.
And they did. By the time we reached the car, exhaustion mingled with a fierce sense of accomplishment. We had done it—we had something that could finally expose Victor for what he was. As we drove away, Ford glanced at the rearview mirror, his face tense.
“We can’t go home. Not yet.
He’s going to know someone was there, and he’ll be looking for us.” It was true. Victor wouldn’t rest until he found out who had infiltrated his operation.
We were officially fugitives now, hiding from both sides—Victor and the police, who would be questioning why we hadn’t come to them first. The only safe place we could think of was an old cabin Ford’s uncle owned out by the lake. Isolated and off the grid, it was our only shot at staying hidden long enough to analyze the information we’d gathered. As we settled into the cabin, a new resolve began to form. We weren’t just a few people stumbling in the dark anymore.
We were equipped, united, and we had Victor’s own secrets to use against him. The balance had shifted. For the first time, we weren’t just surviving—we were fighting back.
The cabin became our sanctuary, a place where fear transformed into strategy, and hope sharpened into purpose. Each night we pored over Victor’s files, piecing together his network, his crimes, his allies, and his vulnerabilities. We discovered names—people in positions of power, silently aiding him. The depth of his influence was staggering, but it only fueled our resolve further.
And so, as dawn broke each day over the quiet lake, we knew one thing with certainty: we wouldn’t stop until Victor’s empire was nothing but ashes. The days at the cabin passed in a tense blur. Each morning, we reviewed the evidence and strategized our next move, and each night, we slept lightly, alert to every sound outside. We had no way of knowing how close Victor’s people were or how soon they’d come looking, but we knew it was only a matter of time.
Our biggest break came one evening when Mia discovered an encrypted file hidden in the documents we’d taken from Victor’s command center. She spent hours decoding it, her face illuminated by the glow of the laptop screen, until finally, with a triumphant click, the file unlocked. "It's a ledger," she whispered, barely containing her excitement. "This has everything—payments, locations, even names. It's a complete map of Victor's entire operation.
" Ford and I leaned over her shoulder, reading line after line of incriminating data. The ledger detailed years of illegal dealings, from bribes to high-ranking officials to transactions involving arms shipments. And then there were the names—public figures, police officers, business owners—all of them complicit in Victor's schemes. Ford clenched his fists, his voice trembling with a mix of anger and determination.
“This is it. This is the proof we need to bring him down. With this, there’s no way he can cover it up.” But we knew the risks.
If Victor realized we had this ledger, he’d stop at nothing to silence us. We had to be strategic about how we used it. After hours of planning, we agreed on a new approach: we’d leak small pieces of the ledger to the media, enough to stir public interest and force an official investigation, but not enough for Victor to know we had the entire file. With the press involved, it would be harder for Victor to quietly eliminate us without drawing attention. Over the next few days, we carefully selected names and transactions to release.
We reached out to a few trusted reporters anonymously, sharing only what we could safely disclose. The response was immediate. Headlines flashed across the news, detailing the corruption and connections within the city’s most powerful circles.
Suddenly, Victor was no longer the silent puppeteer in the shadows—he was a public enemy, his empire exposed to the harsh light of scrutiny. But with each article, the tension around us thickened.
Victor’s people were now on high alert, and every movement outside the cabin felt like it could be the start of an ambush. Ford was constantly checking the perimeter, his eyes sharp and his demeanor serious. Mia and I kept monitoring the news and staying in contact with our allies in the press, but it was clear we were pushing our luck. We had lit a fire, and soon, the blaze would either consume Victor or us.
One night, as I sat on the cabin porch looking out at the quiet lake, Ford joined me, his gaze distant. “We’re making progress,” he said, his voice calm but weary. “But we’re not safe. Victor’s bound to strike back soon.
We need a backup plan.” I nodded, understanding what he meant. We couldn’t rely on the media alone; we needed to hand over the entire ledger to someone who could act fast and decisively. The next morning, we made contact with a special investigator—an old friend of Ford’s who had experience taking down criminal networks. He was reluctant at first, wary of the risks, but when we showed him the extent of Victor’s corruption, he agreed to help. We arranged a meeting in a quiet location outside the city, hoping to pass off the ledger safely.
But as we approached the meeting point, my phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number: You’re not as invisible as you think.
I know where you are. My heart dropped, and I showed the message to Ford and Mia. Victor had found us.
“Change of plans,” Ford said immediately, turning the car around. “We’re not going to make the drop. We need to get somewhere safe, fast.” We drove in silence, hearts pounding as we tried to think of our next move.
But the roads felt too open, too exposed.
Every car we passed, every unfamiliar face on the street, felt like a threat. Just as the sun was setting, we found a secluded spot by an old, run-down motel on the outskirts of town. It wasn’t much, but it would keep us hidden for the night. As we settled into the dingy motel room, we realized just how close Victor’s reach really was. He was closing in, and we were running out of places to hide.
That night, as we gathered around the small motel table, I looked at my friends, exhaustion and fear etched into their faces. “We can’t keep running forever,” I said quietly. “If we’re going to stop him, we need to go on the offensive.
We have to force his hand, make him come to us on our terms.” Mia nodded slowly. “We could leak the rest of the ledger, all at once. The fallout would be massive. Victor wouldn’t be able to hide anymore, and his people would scatter to save themselves.” Ford thought for a moment, then met my eyes. “If we do that, it means there’s no going back. This is the final play.” We all sat in silence, the weight of the decision pressing down on us. Then, one by one, we agreed.
We’d put everything on the line. The next morning, Mia sent the entire ledger to the press, a digital bomb waiting to explode. Within hours, every media outlet was covering the story. Victor’s face was plastered on every screen, his network dismantling piece by piece as his closest allies scrambled to distance themselves.
We knew he’d be furious, that he’d come after us with everything he had left. But for the first time, it felt like we were in control.
That evening, as we watched the news from the motel room, a knock came at the door. We froze, exchanging tense glances, each of us knowing what this could mean. Ford stood up, moving to the door and looking through the peephole. He turned back to us, his face set with a grim determination. “It’s him,” he whispered.
Victor had come to settle things in person. Ford looked at us, his gaze steady. “Whatever happens, we finish this.
We don’t back down.” We each took a deep breath, ready for the final confrontation. This was it—the moment we’d been building toward.
We had risked everything, and now it was time to see if we’d truly be able to bring Victor’s empire to its knees, or if we’d be the ones to fall. The door creaked open, and as Victor stepped into the room, a chilling smile on his face, I knew one thing for certain: no matter the outcome, we would fight until the very end. Victor’s smile lingered for a moment, but it was a cold, calculating expression.
The door creaked shut behind him, but the brief silence that followed felt like an eternity. Our hearts raced, each of us knowing that this moment, the one we had been preparing for, had finally arrived. Ford remained still, his gaze fixed on Victor, unwavering. “We’re doing this,” Ford said, his voice steady, though there was a slight tension beneath the surface.
Victor’s eyes narrowed, and he took a slow step toward the center of the room. The smirk that had been on his face vanished, replaced by a cold determination. “This ends tonight,” he said, his voice low but clear. Ford didn’t flinch.
“It ends when we say it ends. And that won’t be tonight.” For a brief moment, it felt as though the air in the room grew thick, charged with the weight of everything we had risked. The years of plotting, the hours of preparation, all led to this final moment. The tension was palpable, and none of us could look away.
The time for talking was over. Victor raised his hands, palms out, as though showing us he was unarmed. But we knew better.
“You think you can stop me?” he asked, his tone mocking. “We’re not here to stop you,” Ford replied, taking a step closer. “We’re here to finish this.” And with that, the room seemed to snap into motion.
The fight had begun. Victor’s gaze hardened, his lips curling into a grin that sent a chill down my spine. “You’ve made a mistake,” he said, his voice a low, dangerous whisper. “You’ve underestimated me, and now you’ll pay the price.” Ford stepped forward, his expression unwavering. “We don’t fear you, Victor.
Not anymore.” The room felt smaller with every passing second. The tension was almost unbearable, and yet, in the midst of it all, I felt something stirring within me—an energy I hadn’t known I was capable of. The fight was no longer just a necessity.
It was personal. Victor had crossed a line, and now we had to cross the point of no return. Victor raised an eyebrow, as if sensing the shift in the room. “You think this will end how you want?” he asked, his voice tinged with a mix of amusement and derision. He seemed almost confident, as though he knew something we didn’t.
“The truth is, you’ve already lost.” I clenched my fists, my mind racing. There was no turning back now.
This wasn’t just about victory—it was about survival. The stakes had risen far beyond what we had originally thought. Without warning, Victor lunged forward.
His movement was quick, calculated, and precise. Ford reacted instantly, his body shifting to intercept the strike. The sound of the clash echoed through the room as Ford and Victor collided, both locked in a struggle that seemed almost too fast for the eye to follow. Victor grinned, twisting his body with the agility of a trained fighter.
“You’re too slow,” he taunted. Ford didn’t answer. Instead, he shifted his weight and delivered a quick, powerful blow to Victor’s midsection. Victor staggered back, his smirk faltering for the briefest moment.
“Not so fast,” Ford said, his voice calm, but filled with a quiet intensity. He wasn’t going to give Victor the satisfaction of seeing him break. Victor growled in frustration, his eyes burning with fury.
“You think this is over?” he spat, his voice sharp as a knife. “This is just the beginning. You’re fighting a battle you can’t win.” Ford squared his shoulders, his posture solid, his resolve unshakable. “We’ll see about that.” The fight raged on, neither side giving an inch. The sound of punches landing, the crackle of tension, it all blended together in a blur. But as the minutes ticked by, something began to change.
It wasn’t just the strength of their blows or the precision of their movements—it was the will behind them. Ford wasn’t fighting just for himself anymore. He was fighting for all of us. And as for Victor, his arrogance was starting to falter.
His movements, once so sure, now seemed desperate. A sudden shift in the momentum caught Victor off guard. Ford moved with a speed and fluidity that even Victor couldn’t anticipate. With a sharp, decisive movement, Ford knocked Victor to the ground, his knee pinning him in place.
Victor gasped, fury and disbelief mixing in his eyes. “This isn’t over,” he hissed, but there was a crack in his voice now, a sign of uncertainty. “You may have won this round, but I will come for you. All of you.” Ford leaned in, his face inches from Victor’s.
“Not if we can help it.” For a long moment, neither of them moved. The silence was deafening, the weight of the finality hanging in the air. And then, slowly, Ford stood up, offering a hand to the defeated Victor. Victor looked at the hand, his chest heaving with anger, but he didn’t take it.
Instead, he pushed himself up, brushing off the dust. “This isn’t over,” he repeated, his voice quieter this time, tinged with a mix of frustration and reluctant respect. Ford nodded, acknowledging Victor’s resolve. But it was clear.
The battle was over, and it was Ford’s side that had won. As Victor turned and walked toward the door, his back still straight, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of accomplishment. This was the moment we had worked toward, and we had come out victorious. But there was no time to celebrate.
The war, as Victor had said, was far from over. We had won this battle, bu t the fight for our future was just beginning. Ford watched Victor leave, his expression unreadable. “We’ll be ready for him,” he muttered, his voice steady but resolute. We nodded in agreement.
Whatever came next, we would face it together. As the door slammed shut behind Victor, the silence that filled the room felt heavy. We all stood frozen for a moment, processing what had just happened.
Ford’s chest rose and fell with each deep breath, but his expression remained calm—focused. “We’ve made it this far,” he said quietly, looking at each of us in turn. “But this isn’t the end. Not by a long shot.” I felt a chill run down my spine as the gravity of his words settled in.
Victor had left, but he wasn’t defeated—not yet. And whatever he had planned for us next, we had to be ready. The thought of him plotting in the shadows, watching our every move, made me uneasy. “We can’t let our guard down,” I said, my voice steady, though I could feel the tension in my shoulders. “We need a plan.” Ford nodded.
“We’ll have one. We’ve always been ahead of him, and that’s not going to change.” Victor’s empire was vast, its reach extending into every corner of the city. But we knew its cracks, its weaknesses.
We had spent years gathering intel, making alliances, and preparing for this moment. Now, it was time to turn that preparation into action. Victor had underestimated us.
He thought he could intimidate us, wear us down. But he didn’t understand that we weren’t just fighting for our own survival.
We were fighting for something greater. “We need to hit him where it hurts,” said Rachel, her voice cutting through the tension. “His operations, his connections, his influence.
We take away his power.” “And we do it now,” Ford added, determination hardening his tone. “We don’t wait for him to make his next move. We make the first one.” We gathered around the table, our minds already racing with possibilities.
There was no room for hesitation now. We had come too far to back down, too many lives depended on our success. The plan began to take shape. Rachel would lead the strike on one of Victor’s key operations, a warehouse where he was storing weapons for his upcoming deal.
It was the perfect target—vital, but not without risks. “We’ll hit them at dawn,” Ford said. “By the time they know what’s happening, it’ll be too late.” Victor would never see it coming.
The next few hours were spent preparing—gathering intel, checking equipment, and finalizing details. The weight of what we were about to do hung heavily in the air, but there was no turning back now. This was our moment. As dawn approached, we suited up, our hearts beating in unison. We were ready to take the fight to Victor.
No more waiting.
No more uncertainty.
“This ends today,” I muttered under my breath as we moved toward the exit. Ford gave a brief nod, his eyes steely. “Let’s finish this.” And with that, we set out into the early morning light, determined to end the war once and for all. As we reached the outskirts of the warehouse, the first light of dawn broke over the horizon. The sky was painted in shades of orange and pink, but there was no beauty in the moment. Our minds were set, our focus sharp. We were here for one thing: to take down Victor’s empire, and we couldn’t afford any distractions.
Rachel, as always, led the way. She was the strateg ist, the one who could think five steps ahead and execute with precision. The rest of us followed closely behind, our movements coordinated, silent. Every step felt like a countdown to the inevitable.
We crouched low as we approached the entrance, the large steel doors looming ahead. Ford motioned for us to stop, signaling that he would take the lead in breaching the door. He checked his equipment one last time, his eyes scanning the perimeter for any signs of movement. "On my signal," he whispered.
The seconds felt like hours, the tension thick in the air. Then, with a single motion, Ford swung the heavy door open, and we flooded into the warehouse. The interior was dimly lit, shadows stretching long across the concrete floor. Rows of crates were stacked high, and the distant hum of machinery echoed throughout the space.
We knew Victor’s men would be inside—armed and alert—but we were ready. “Move fast, keep quiet,” Ford ordered, his voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through his veins. We split into teams.
Rachel and I moved to the left, covering the flank, while Ford and Jake headed toward the main storage area. The plan was simple: disable the security, secure the weapons, and leave before anyone could call for reinforcements. No room for mistakes.
The seconds ticked by, each one drawing us closer to the heart of Victor’s operation. The warehouse was eerily quiet—too quiet. But we had trained for moments like this, prepared for the unexpected.
Every step was calculated, every movement precise. Then, as we reached the storage area, the first shots rang out. A burst of gunfire shattered the stillness, and everything exploded into chaos. The quiet was gone, replaced by the sound of shouting and the crack of bullets ricocheting off metal. Rachel reacted instantly, diving behind a stack of crates, pulling me with her.
I barely had time to process the explosion of noise before she was already pulling her gun and returning fire. “Keep moving!” she shouted over the din.
I nodded, adrenaline kicking in. We had no choice but to fight our way through.
We had to secure the weapons, and we had to do it now. As we moved forward, I saw Ford and Jake up ahead, clearing a path through the enemy with precision. Ford was a machine, every shot landing where it needed to. But Victor’s men were numerous, and they were trained.
It wasn’t going to be easy, but we had the advantage—this was our fight. We pushed forward, securing the crates of weapons as planned, but the firefight wasn’t over yet. More men appeared from the shadows, their faces masked with determination. We were outnumbered, but we weren’t backing down.
“Rachel, cover me!” I shouted, taking a step forward to draw attention away from her. The plan had changed now—we couldn’t just stay hidden. We had to finish this.
She fired a shot that took one of the guards down, allowing me to get a better angle. I sprinted toward another stack of crates, my heart racing, every nerve in my body on edge. But there was no time to think—only to act.
As we continued to fight our way through, it became clear that we were close. The sound of more footsteps echoed in the distance, and I knew reinforcements were on the way. We had to finish what we started, or we wouldn’t make it out. Finally, we reached the heart of the operation—the storage room where Victor’s most valuable weapons were kept. Ford and Jake were already there, holding off the remaining guards.
It was a race against time now. “Get those crates!” Ford yelled as he fired another round. I moved swiftly, locking the crates into place with a satisfying click. It was done.
The weapons were secured. But we weren’t out of the woods yet.
“Move out!” Ford ordered, his voice grim. “We’ve got what we came for, now let’s get out before the cavalry arrives.” With the weapons secured, we retraced our steps, moving quickly through the warehouse. The air was thick with tension, the sounds of pursuit growing louder. But we had the edge.
The mission was a success. We reached the exit, and just as we were about to step into the alleyway outside, the unmistakable sound of a vehicle screeched to a halt nearby. The reinforcements were here.
“Go!” Ford shouted, and we ran. The chase had begun. The sound of footsteps pounding on the concrete grew louder behind us, but we didn’t dare look back.
Every muscle in my body screamed with exhaustion, but adrenaline kept me moving. We darted through the narrow alley, weaving between dumpsters and stacks of discarded crates. There was no time to slow down; the reinforcements were closing in fast. “Keep pushing!” Ford shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos. His pace was unrelenting, a testament to his leadership.
He wasn’t just in charge—he was the heartbeat of this operation. Rachel was right beside me, her breath heavy but controlled. “We need to get to the van,” she said between gasps.
“It’s our only way out.” We had arranged for a getaway vehicle, parked a few blocks away, but getting there wouldn’t be easy. With Victor’s men hot on our trail, the streets wouldn’t be safe for long. We had to make it there before they could set up a blockade.
We burst onto a main street, where the early morning light began to flood the city. The world felt like it was moving in slow motion—except for us, sprinting like our lives depended on it. And they did. Jake, always the quick thinker, glanced around.
“We need a distraction. Something to throw them off our trail.” Before I could respond, he pulled a small device from his jacket pocket and activated it. A loud explosion erupted a few blocks down the street, sending a plume of smoke into the sky. It was just enough to cause confusion, enough to slow down their pursuit. “Go!” Ford shouted, already running toward the van parked just ahead.
We didn’t waste any time. The van was our lifeline now, and we had to make it there before Victor’s men regrouped. I could hear the screeching of tires as a black SUV appeared at the far end of the street, its engine revving as it sped toward us.
But we were faster, moving with a singular purpose.
We reached the van, and Ford was the first to jump inside, slamming the door behind him. Rachel was next, followed by Jake. I was last, and as I climbed into the back, I could feel the tension in my chest release—just a little. “Drive, now!” Ford barked at the driver, who slammed the accelerator to the floor. We sped away, the tires squealing as we tore down the street, leaving the chaos behind us. I glanced out the back window, watching as the black SUV tried to follow, but it was too late. We were already merging onto the highway, the city growing smaller in the distance.
The pursuit was over—for now. But the fight wasn’t.
“We did it,” Rachel said, her voice low but triumphant. She wiped the sweat from her forehead, her hands still trembling from the adrenaline rush. “Not yet,” Ford replied, his gaze fixed ahead. “Victor’s not going to let this go. This was just one battle in a much bigger war.” I nodded, knowing he was right.
This wasn’t the end. It was just the beginning. We had taken down one of Victor’s key operations, but his empire was vast, and his anger would be immense. He would come after us with everything he had. “We’ll be ready,” Jake said, looking around at the rest of us.
“Whatever comes next, we’ll face it together.” We all nodded, a silent agreement between us. Our bond was unbreakable. No matter how high the stakes got, we would keep fighting.
And we would bring Victor down. The rest of the drive was silent, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The road ahead was uncertain, but one thing was clear: we were no longer just running from Victor. We were hunting him.
The van rattled as we sped down the highway, the engine’s hum a constant reminder of the danger we had narrowly escaped. The city lights faded in the rearview mirror, and the open road stretched ahead like a path into the unknown. But none of us were naïve enough to think the danger was over.
If anything, it had just begun. Ford sat in the front, his fingers drumming nervously on the dashboard. “We need to regroup,” he muttered under his breath.
“We need a plan.” Rachel, always the pragmatic one, leaned forward from the back seat. “We need information. We hit one of Victor’s supply routes, but he’s too connected.
We need to know what he’s planning next.” Jake nodded. “We’ve taken out a few key players, but his operation is far from crippled. He’ll adapt.” I stared out the window, watching the landscape blur as we raced through the night. The weight of the mission settled deeper into my chest. We hadn’t just made enemies tonight—we’d made a target of the most powerful man in the underground world.
Victor wasn’t someone you crossed without consequences. And now, we were marked. “We need to find someone on the inside,” I said, breaking the silence. My voice felt foreign, but it was clear.
“Someone who can give us the leverage we need.” Ford glanced at me through the rearview mirror. “You have someone in mind?” I hesitated, considering the options. “There’s an informant—Tasha. She used to work with Victor’s people.
She’s risky, but she might know more about his next move than anyone else.” Rachel shifted, her eyes narrowing. “Is she trustworthy?” “She has her own agenda,” I said, “but she’s not loyal to Victor. That’s the only thing that matters right now.” Ford was silent for a moment, weighing the decision.
“Alright.
We’ll find her. But if this goes south, it’s on you.” I nodded, fully aware of the gravity of the situation.
Tasha was a wildcard, but we didn’t have many options left. She was our best chance at staying ahead of Victor’s next move. The rest of the drive was spent in quiet determination, each of us preparing mentally for the next step.
We were still miles away from our destination—an old warehouse on the edge of town, a place where we could lay low for a few hours before making contact with Tasha. As the van made the final turn, we saw the dim outline of the warehouse ahead. It looked abandoned, but I knew better. This was the kind of place that Victor’s enemies used to disappear—to plan and regroup.
“Stay sharp,” Ford ordered as the van slowed to a stop. “We don’t know who’s watching.” We filed out of the van quickly, moving toward the entrance of the warehouse with careful steps.
The place smelled of dust and disuse, but there was an undercurrent of tension in the air. We were being watched. I could feel it. Inside, the dim lighting cast long shadows across the walls. It was quiet—too quiet—and my hand instinctively went to the gun at my side.
Every corner felt like it was hiding something, and my instincts were on high alert. “There she is,” Rachel murmured, nodding toward a figure standing near the far wall. A woman, tall and lean, with short black hair and sharp eyes that didn’t miss a thing. It was Tasha.
She didn’t speak right away, just watched us with that cold, calculating gaze. “I knew you’d come for me eventually,” she said, her voice smooth, almost bored. “But I’m not in the business of doing favors.” “You’re not here for favors,” Ford replied. “We need information.
Victor’s next move.” Tasha’s eyes flickered with a hint of something—recognition, maybe even fear—but it passed quickly. “You’re playing a dangerous game. He’s not just some petty criminal you can take down. Victor is untouchable.” “We’ve already touched him,” I said.
“We took down one of his operations tonight. Now he’s going to come after us. You tell us what he’s planning, and we’ll deal with him. You stay out of it.” Her gaze shifted toward the door, as though considering something.
“You’re lucky I’m not loyal to him anymore. But you’re also lucky I’m not dead.” She sighed and leaned back against the wall. “Alright.
I’ll tell you what I know, but there’s a price.” I didn’t hesitate. “What is it?” “I want out,” she said flatly.
“No more running, no more hiding.
You help me disappear, and I’ll give you everything you need to take down Victor.” Ford stepped forward, eyes hard. “You’ll get what you want. But you better make sure you’re not playing both sides.” “I’m not playing anything,” Tasha shot back. “I’m just trying to stay alive.” We locked eyes, and for a moment, I wondered if I could trust her.
But there was no turning back now.
We needed her. “Deal,” I said. “Now tell us what you know.” Tasha leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as she spoke. “Victor’s got a new shipment coming in—heavy artillery, enough to start a small war.
It’s scheduled to hit the docks in two days. That’s the moment you strike.” We all exchanged glances, the weight of the information settling in.
This was it. The final push.
The wind howled like a banshee across the desolate expanse of the Alarian Desert, whipping sand against the weathered face of Elara, the last alchemist of her kind. Her weathered leather cloak billowed behind her like a tattered banner as she trudged through the endless dunes, her eyes narrowed against the harsh sunlight. Elara's once-vibrant green eyes were now clouded with fatigue and despair. The weight of her burden, the last remnants of her people's ancient knowledge, pressed heavily upon her.
The Alchemists of Alaria, once revered for their mastery of the elements and their ability to heal the land, were now hunted and ostracized, their magic deemed too powerful, too unpredictable by the tyrannical King Azrael. Elara clutched the tattered leather pouch containing the few remaining Alaria Texts, their ancient script barely visible under the relentless erosion of sand and time. These texts held the secrets of her people's magic, the delicate balance between the elements that had sustained Alaria for centuries.
If she lost them, the knowledge would be lost forever, plunging Alaria into an age of darkness and decay. Suddenly, a flicker of movement caught her eye. A lone Sand Serpent, its scales shimmering like gold under the sun, slithered towards her, its forked tongue tasting the air. Elara's hand instinctively went to the silver dagger strapped to her thigh, her heart hammering against her ribs.
Sand Serpents were deadly creatures, their venom capable of liquefying flesh in seconds. But Elara knew she couldn't afford to panic.
She needed to be resourceful, to use the elements around her to her advantage. Drawing a deep breath, she focused her mind, channeling the fiery spirit of the sun into her hands. A flicker of orange light sparked at her fingertips, growing brighter until it formed a blazing ball of fire. With a determined cry, Elara hurled the fireball at the Sand Serpent.
The creature shrieked in agony as the flames engulfed it, its body dissolving into dust before it could strike. Exhausted but relieved, Elara sank to her knees, the heat from the fire clinging to her skin. She had survived another encounter, but she knew the journey ahead would be fraught with peril. The desert held many dangers, not just from Sand Serpents, but from the King's men who hunted her relentlessly.
But Elara refused to give up.
The fate of her people, the future of Alaria, rested upon her shoulders. She would continue to fight, to protect the last remnants of her heritage, and to find a way to restore balance to the land she loved. As the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the desert in a fiery glow, Elara stood tall, her resol Nepal: A Land of Enchantment Nestled amidst the majestic Himalayas, Nepal is a land where ancient traditions blend seamlessly with modern influences.

Daily Life Conversation: Coffee Shop Encounter Setting: A cozy coffee shop in the afternoon.
The warm aroma of coffee beans fills the air as sunlight streams through the windows. Characters: Sarah: A young professional, dressed in business attire, working on her laptop. Mark: An elderly gentleman, reading a book and sipping coffee. [SCENE START] Sarah: (Sighs deeply, rubbing her tired eyes) Ugh, this report is never going to finish itself. Mark: (Looks up from his book with a smile) Rough day?
Sarah: (Startled, looks up) Oh, I didn't see you there. Yeah, it's been one of those days.
Deadlines, meetings, the whole shebang.
Mark: I remember those days. The corporate grind can be a real beast. Sarah: You seem to be enjoying yours. The book, the coffee, the calmnessâ€¦ it's all very enviable.
Mark: (Chuckles) It has its perks. Retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be, but I do enjoy the simple things now. Sarah: Simple things?
Like reading a book in a coffee shop?
Mark: Exactly. It's the little moments that we often miss amidst the rush of everyday life. The smell of freshly brewed coffee, the feel of turning a page, the chance encounter with a strangerâ€¦ Sarah: (Thinks for a moment) You know, you're right.
I've been so focused on getting ahead that I've forgotten to appreciate the little things. Mark: We all get caught up in the rat race sometimes. But it's important to take a step back and remind ourselves what truly matters.
Sarah: I think I needed to hear that. Thank you. Mark: You're welcome, young lady. Now, how about another cup of coffee?
It's on me. Sarah: (Smiling) I'd love that. And maybe, just maybe, I can focus on the book instead of the report for a while. Mark: (Nods) That's the spirit.
Remember, life is a journey, not a race. So take your time, smell the coffee beans, and enjoy the ride. Sarah: I will.
Thank you again for everything. Mark: (Gestures to the book) By the way, if you ever want to escape from the corporate world for a while, this book is a great place to start. Sarah: (Takes the book) I'll definitely give it a try.
Thank you for the recommendation. [SCENE END] This is just a sample conversation, and you can modify it to your liking.

The Last Coffee Shop: Chapter 1 - A Spark of Rebellion Setting: A hidden alleyway in a bustling cityscape.
Sunlight filters through the grimy windows of a small, unassuming establishment called "The Last Drip." Inside, the warm aroma of coffee mingles with hushed conversations and the rhythmic clinking of spoons against ceramic mugs.
Characters: Eleanor (20s): Fiery and determined owner of The Last Drip, a skilled barista with a passion for freedom. David (30s): A weary journalist seeking solace and information in The Last Drip, haunted by his past. Agent Thorne (40s): A ruthless enforcer of the coffee ban, driven by a dark secret.
[SCENE START] Eleanor meticulously polishes the countertop, her movements fluid and practiced. The morning rush has subsided, leaving only a handful of patrons huddled over steaming mugs, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of hanging lamps. An air of secrecy and quiet defiance hangs heavy in the air. David enters, his eyes scanning the dimly lit space.
He's drawn to the aroma of coffee, a forbidden scent in a city where the government has outlawed its consumption. His weathered face carries a worn expression, a testament to years spent chasing stories and facing danger. "Is this...
The Last Drip?" he asks in a hushed tone. Eleanor raises an eyebrow, a hint of amusement playing on her lips. "That's right.
Last stop on the caffeine train.
What can I get you?"
David hesitates, taking in the clandestine atmosphere. The other patrons, a diverse mix of artists, intellectuals, and everyday citizens seeking a taste of the past, cast him curious glances. "Black," he says finally, his voice barely above a whisper. "Strong.
" Eleanor nods, her movements a symphony of precision as she grinds the beans, measures the water, and extracts the perfect cup of coffee. The aroma alone is enough to awaken David's senses, transporting him back to a time before the ban, a time when coffee wasn't a rebellious act but a simple pleasure enjoyed by all.
As David savors the first sip, his eyes widen in surprise. The flavor is nothing like the synthetic substitutes he's forced to endure. It's bold, rich, and complex, a reminder of a forgotten world. "This is..." he begins, his voice thick with emotion.
"This is incredible. I haven't tasted anything like it."
"It's real coffee, friend," Eleanor replies, her voice low and conspiratorial.
"Not the synthetic trash they call coffee on the streets. We serve more than just a drink here.
We serve a reminder of freedom, of what life used to be like. " David looks around the room, his gaze flickering over the faces of the patrons. He sees a shared yearning for something more, a spark of rebellion burning just beneath the surface. In this hidden sanctuary, amidst the fragrant steam and whispered conversations, he senses a movement growing, a resistance against the oppressive regime that controls their lives.
Suddenly, the door bursts open and a figure strides in, his face etched with grim determination. It's Agent Thorne, a man feared and respected for his ruthless enforcement of the coffee ban. His presence instantly silences the room, replacing the murmur of conversation with a tense silence. "This establishment is in violation of the Coffee Prohibition Act," Thorne announces in a cold, authoritative voice.
"You are all under arrest."
[TO BE CONTINUED] This is just the beginning of Chapter 1.

It was seven oâ€™clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his dayâ€™s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. â€œAugrh!â€ said Father Wolf.
â€œIt is time to hunt again.â€ He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: â€œGood luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.â€ It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way.
Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run.
â€œEnter, then, and look,â€ said Father Wolf stiffly, â€œbut there is no food here.â€ â€œFor a wolf, no,â€ said Tabaqui, â€œbut for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?â€ He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily.
â€œAll thanks for this good meal,â€ he said, licking his lips. â€œHow beautiful are the noble children!
How large are their eyes! And so young too!
Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning.â€ Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then he said spitefully: â€œShere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt among these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.â€ Shere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty miles away.
â€œHe has no right!â€ Father Wolf began angrily--â€œBy the Law of the Jungle he has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for two, these days.â€ â€œHis mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,â€ said Mother Wolf quietly. â€œHe has been lame in one foot from his birth.
That is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are angry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry. They will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our children must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very grateful to Shere Khan!â€ â€œShall I tell him of your gratitude?â€ said Tabaqui.
â€œOut!â€ snapped Father Wolf. â€œOut and hunt with thy master.
Thou hast done harm enough for one night.â€ â€œI go,â€ said Tabaqui quietly. â€œYe can hear Shere Khan below in the thickets. I might have saved myself the message.â€ Father Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little river he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has caught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.
â€œThe fool!â€ said Father Wolf. â€œTo begin a nightâ€™s work with that noise! Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?â€ â€œHâ€™sh.
It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,â€ said Mother Wolf. â€œIt is Man.â€ The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.
â€œMan!â€ said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. â€œFaugh!
Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!â€ The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.
Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth. The purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated â€œAaarh!â€ of the tigerâ€™s charge. Then there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan.
â€œHe has missed,â€ said Mother Wolf. â€œWhat is it?â€ Father Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and mumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub. â€œThe fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutterâ€™s campfire, and has burned his feet,â€ said Father Wolf with a grunt.
â€œTabaqui is with him.â€ â€œSomething is coming uphill,â€ said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. â€œGet ready.â€ The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the wolf checked in mid-spring.
He made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing almost where he left ground. â€œMan!â€ he snapped. â€œA manâ€™s cub.
Look!â€ Directly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked brown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom as ever came to a wolfâ€™s cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolfâ€™s face, and laughed. â€œIs that a manâ€™s cub?â€ said Mother Wolf. â€œI have never seen one. Bring it here.â€ A Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg without breaking it, and though Father Wolfâ€™s jaws closed right on the childâ€™s back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down among the cubs.
â€œHow little!
How naked, and--how bold!â€ said Mother Wolf softly. The baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.
â€œAhai! He is taking his meal with the others.
And so this is a manâ€™s cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a manâ€™s cub among her children?â€ â€œI have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in my time,â€ said Father Wolf. â€œHe is altogether without hair, and I could kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not afraid.â€ The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khanâ€™s great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance.
Tabaqui, behind him, was squeaking: â€œMy lord, my lord, it went in here!â€ â€œShere Khan does us great honor,â€ said Father Wolf, but his eyes were very angry. â€œWhat does Shere Khan need?â€ â€œMy quarry. A manâ€™s cub went this way,â€ said Shere Khan. â€œIts parents have run off. Give it to me.â€ Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutterâ€™s campfire, as Father Wolf had said, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet.
But Father Wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by.
Even where he was, Shere Khanâ€™s shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room, as a manâ€™s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel. â€œThe Wolves are a free people,â€ said Father Wolf. â€œThey take orders from the Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The manâ€™s cub is ours--to kill if we choose.â€ â€œYe choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing?
By the bull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dogâ€™s den for my fair dues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!â€ The tigerâ€™s roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.
â€œAnd it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The manâ€™s cub is mine, Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee!
Now get hence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back thou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever thou camest into the world! Go!â€ Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in the Pack and was not called The Demon for complimentâ€™s sake.
Shere Khan might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth growling, and when he was clear he shouted: â€œEach dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to this fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will come in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!â€ Mother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf said to her gravely: â€œShere Khan speaks this much truth.
The cub must be shown to the Pack. Wilt thou still keep him, Mother?â€ â€œKeep him!â€ she gasped.
â€œHe came naked, by night, alone and very hungry; yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side already.
And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little frog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will come when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.â€ â€œBut what will our Pack say?â€ said Father Wolf. The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order that the other wolves may identify them.
After that inspection the cubs are free to run where they please, and until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one of them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so.
Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a year now.
He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet.
Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: â€œYe know the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!â€ And the anxious mothers would take up the call: â€œLook--look well, O Wolves!â€ At last--and Mother Wolfâ€™s neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father Wolf pushed â€œMowgli the Frog,â€ as they called him, into the center, where he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in the moonlight.
Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the monotonous cry: â€œLook well!â€ A muffled roar came up from behind the rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: â€œThe cub is mine. Give him to me. What have the Free People to do with a manâ€™s cub?â€ Akela never even twitched his ears.
All he said was: â€œLook well, O Wolves! What have the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look well!â€ There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khanâ€™s question to Akela: â€œWhat have the Free People to do with a manâ€™s cub?â€ Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother. â€œWho speaks for this cub?â€ said Akela.
â€œAmong the Free People who speaks?â€ There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew would be her last fight, if things came to fighting. Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted. â€œThe manâ€™s cub--the manâ€™s cub?â€ he said. â€œI speak for the manâ€™s cub.
There is no harm in a manâ€™s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak the truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I myself will teach him.â€ â€œWe need yet another,â€ said Akela.
â€œBaloo has spoken, and he is our teacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?â€ A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.
â€œO Akela, and ye the Free People,â€ he purred, â€œI have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?â€ â€œGood!
Good!â€ said the young wolves, who are always hungry. â€œListen to Bagheera.
The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.â€ â€œKnowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.â€ â€œSpeak then,â€ cried twenty voices. â€œTo kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you when he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf.
Now to Balooâ€™s word I will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile from here, if ye will accept the manâ€™s cub according to the Law. Is it difficult?â€ There was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: â€œWhat matter? He will die in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun.
What harm can a naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.â€ And then came Akelaâ€™s deep bay, crying: â€œLook well--look well, O Wolves!â€ Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgliâ€™s own wolves were left.
Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him. â€œAy, roar well,â€ said Bagheera, under his whiskers, â€œfor the time will come when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I know nothing of man.â€ â€œIt was well done,â€ said Akela. â€œMen and their cubs are very wise.
He may be a help in time.â€ â€œTruly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack forever,â€ said Bagheera. Akela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every leader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler and feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader comes up--to be killed in his turn.
â€œTake him away,â€ he said to Father Wolf, â€œand train him as befits one of the Free People.â€ And that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the price of a bull and on Balooâ€™s good word. Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a batâ€™s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man.
When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, â€œCome along, Little Brother,â€ and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth, but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too, when the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare for fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats.
He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night, and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it, and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand things, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the Pack at the price of a bullâ€™s life.
â€œAll the jungle is thine,â€ said Bagheera, â€œand thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of the Jungle.â€ Mowgli obeyed faithfully. And he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that he is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of except things to eat. Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature to be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan. But though a young wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot it because he was only a boy--though he would have called himself a wolf if he had been able to speak in any human tongue.
Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a manâ€™s cub. â€œThey tell me,â€ Shere Khan would say, â€œthat at Council ye dare not look him between the eyes.â€ And the young wolves would growl and bristle. Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill him some day.
Mowgli would laugh and answer: â€œI have the Pack and I have thee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my sake. Why should I be afraid?â€ It was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of something that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told him; but he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy lay with his head on Bagheeraâ€™s beautiful black skin, â€œLittle Brother, how often have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?â€ â€œAs many times as there are nuts on that palm,â€ said Mowgli, who, naturally, could not count. â€œWhat of it?
I am sleepy, Bagheera, and Shere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.â€ â€œBut this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack know it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee too.â€ â€œHo! ho!â€ said Mowgli.
â€œTabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude talk that I was a naked manâ€™s cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts.
But I caught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm-tree to teach him better manners.â€ â€œThat was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he would have told thee of something that concerned thee closely.
Open those eyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot kill his buck, and then he will be leader no more.
Many of the wolves that looked thee over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old too, and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that a man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou wilt be a man.â€ â€œAnd what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?â€ said Mowgli. â€œI was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle, and there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn.
Surely they are my brothers!â€ Bagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes. â€œLittle Brother,â€ said he, â€œfeel under my jaw.â€ Mowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheeraâ€™s silky chin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair, he came upon a little bald spot. â€œThere is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry that mark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was born among men, and it was among men that my mother died--in the cages of the kingâ€™s palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that I paid the price for thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too was born among men.
I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind bars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the Panther--and no manâ€™s plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one blow of my paw and came away. And because I had learned the ways of men, I became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan.
Is it not so?â€ â€œYes,â€ said Mowgli, â€œall the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.â€ â€œOh, thou art a manâ€™s cub,â€ said the Black Panther very tenderly. â€œAnd even as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to the men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council.â€ â€œBut why--but why should any wish to kill me?â€ said Mowgli.
â€œLook at me,â€ said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him steadily between the eyes.
The big panther turned his head away in half a minute. â€œThat is why,â€ he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. â€œNot even I can look thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love thee, Little Brother.
The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet thine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out thorns from their feet--because thou art a man.â€ â€œI did not know these things,â€ said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned under his heavy black eyebrows. â€œWhat is the Law of the Jungle?
Strike first and then give tongue. By thy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise.
It is in my heart that when Akela misses his next kill--and at each hunt it costs him more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him and against thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock, and then--and then--I have it!â€ said Bagheera, leaping up. â€œGo thou down quickly to the menâ€™s huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they grow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger friend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love thee.
Get the Red Flower.â€ By Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will call fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it, and invents a hundred ways of describing it.
â€œThe Red Flower?â€ said Mowgli. â€œThat grows outside their huts in the twilight. I will get some.â€ â€œThere speaks the manâ€™s cub,â€ said Bagheera proudly.
â€œRemember that it grows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of need.â€ â€œGood!â€ said Mowgli.
â€œI go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheeraâ€--he slipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big eyes--â€œart thou sure that all this is Shere Khanâ€™s doing?â€ â€œBy the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.â€ â€œThen, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for this, and it may be a little over,â€ said Mowgli, and he bounded away.
â€œThat is a man. That is all a man,â€ said Bagheera to himself, lying down again. â€œOh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt of thine ten years ago!â€ Mowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his heart was hot in him.
He came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew breath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother Wolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that something was troubling her frog. â€œWhat is it, Son?â€ she said. â€œSome batâ€™s chatter of Shere Khan,â€ he called back.
â€œI hunt among the plowed fields tonight,â€ and he plunged downward through the bushes, to the stream at the bottom of the valley. There he checked, for he heard the yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur, and the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter howls from the young wolves: â€œAkela! Akela!
Let the Lone Wolf show his strength.
Room for the leader of the Pack!
Spring, Akela!â€ The Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard the snap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with his forefoot. He did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew fainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers lived. â€œBagheera spoke truth,â€ he panted, as he nestled down in some cattle fodder by the window of a hut. â€œTo-morrow is one day both for Akela and for me.â€ Then he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on the hearth. He saw the husbandmanâ€™s wife get up and feed it in the night with black lumps.
And when the morning came and the mists were all white and cold, he saw the manâ€™s child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside with earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his blanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre. â€œIs that all?â€ said Mowgli. â€œIf a cub can do it, there is nothing to fear.â€ So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from his hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.
â€œThey are very like me,â€ said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had seen the woman do. â€œThis thing will die if I do not give it things to eatâ€; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up the hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his coat.
â€œAkela has missed,â€ said the Panther.
â€œThey would have killed him last night, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the hill.â€ â€œI was among the plowed lands. I am ready.
See!â€ Mowgli held up the fire-pot.
â€œGood! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and presently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not afraid?â€ â€œNo. Why should I fear?
I remember now--if it is not a dream--how, before I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and pleasant.â€ All that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping dry branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that satisfied him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told him rudely enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he laughed till Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing. Akela the Lone Wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the leadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his following of scrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered.
Bagheera lay close to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgliâ€™s knees. When they were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing he would never have dared to do when Akela was in his prime. â€œHe has no right,â€ whispered Bagheera.
â€œSay so.
He is a dogâ€™s son. He will be frightened.â€ Mowgli sprang to his feet. â€œFree People,â€ he cried, â€œdoes Shere Khan lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?â€ â€œSeeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--â€  Shere Khan began.
â€œBy whom?â€ said Mowgli. â€œAre we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle butcher?
The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.â€ There were yells of â€œSilence, thou manâ€™s cub!â€ â€œLet him speak. He has kept our Lawâ€; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: â€œLet the Dead Wolf speak.â€ When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is called the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long. Akela raised his old head wearily:-- â€œFree People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I have led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been trapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill.
Ye know how that plot was made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my weakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on the Council Rock, now.
Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the Lone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come one by one.â€ There was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to the death. Then Shere Khan roared: â€œBah!
What have we to do with this toothless fool? He is doomed to die!
It is the man-cub who has lived too long. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me. I am weary of this man-wolf folly.
He has troubled the jungle for ten seasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give you one bone. He is a man, a manâ€™s child, and from the marrow of my bones I hate him!â€ Then more than half the Pack yelled: â€œA man!
A man!
What has a man to do with us? Let him go to his own place.â€ â€œAnd turn all the people of the villages against us?â€ clamored Shere Khan. â€œNo, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him between the eyes.â€ Akela lifted his head again and said, â€œHe has eaten our food. He has slept with us.
He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the Law of the Jungle.â€ â€œAlso, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a bull is little, but Bagheeraâ€™s honor is something that he will perhaps fight for,â€ said Bagheera in his gentlest voice. â€œA bull paid ten years ago!â€ the Pack snarled.
â€œWhat do we care for bones ten years old?â€ â€œOr for a pledge?â€ said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip. â€œWell are ye called the Free People!â€ â€œNo manâ€™s cub can run with the people of the jungle,â€ howled Shere Khan.
â€œGive him to me!â€ â€œHe is our brother in all but blood,â€ Akela went on, â€œand ye would kill him here! In truth, I have lived too long.
Some of ye are eaters of cattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khanâ€™s teaching, ye go by dark night and snatch children from the villagerâ€™s doorstep. Therefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is certain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer that in the man-cubâ€™s place. But for the sake of the Honor of the Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader ye have forgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his own place, I will not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye.
I will die without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives. More I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that comes of killing a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother spoken for and bought into the Pack according to the Law of the Jungle.â€ â€œHe is a man--a man--a man!â€ snarled the Pack.
And most of the wolves began to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch. â€œNow the business is in thy hands,â€ said Bagheera to Mowgli. â€œWe can do no more except fight.â€ Mowgli stood upright--the fire pot in his hands. Then he stretched out his arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he was furious with rage and sorrow, for, wolflike, the wolves had never told him how they hated him.
â€œListen you!â€ he cried. â€œThere is no need for this dogâ€™s jabber.
Ye have told me so often tonight that I am a man (and indeed I would have been a wolf with you to my lifeâ€™s end) that I feel your words are true. So I do not call ye my brothers any more, but sag [dogs], as a man should. What ye will do, and what ye will not do, is not yours to say.
That matter is with me; and that we may see the matter more plainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of the Red Flower which ye, dogs, fear.â€ He flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit a tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in terror before the leaping flames. Mowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and crackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves. â€œThou art the master,â€ said Bagheera in an undertone.
â€œSave Akela from the death.
He was ever thy friend.â€ Akela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave one piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black hair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that made the shadows jump and quiver.
â€œGood!â€ said Mowgli, staring round slowly. â€œI see that ye are dogs. I go from you to my own people--if they be my own people.
The jungle is shut to me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will be more merciful than ye are.
Because I was all but your brother in blood, I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me.â€ He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks flew up.
â€œThere shall be no war between any of us in the Pack.
But here is a debt to pay before I go.â€ He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.
Bagheera followed in case of accidents. â€œUp, dog!â€ Mowgli cried. â€œUp, when a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!â€ Shere Khanâ€™s ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for the blazing branch was very near. â€œThis cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he had not killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs when we are men.
Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down thy gullet!â€ He beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the tiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear. â€œPah!
Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the Council Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khanâ€™s hide on my head.
For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye will not kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye will sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were somebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!â€ The fire was burning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right and left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks burning their fur.
At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps ten wolves that had taken Mowgliâ€™s part. Then something began to hurt Mowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt in his life before, and he caught his breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his face. â€œWhat is it? What is it?â€ he said.
â€œI do not wish to leave the jungle, and I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?â€ â€œNo, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,â€ said Bagheera.
â€œNow I know thou art a man, and a manâ€™s cub no longer. The jungle is shut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only tears.â€ So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break; and he had never cried in all his life before. â€œNow,â€ he said, â€œI will go to men.
But first I must say farewell to my mother.â€ And he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and he cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably. â€œYe will not forget me?â€ said Mowgli. â€œNever while we can follow a trail,â€ said the cubs. â€œCome to the foot of the hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come into the croplands to play with thee by night.â€ â€œCome soon!â€ said Father Wolf. â€œOh, wise little frog, come again soon; for we be old, thy mother and I.â€ â€œCome soon,â€ said Mother Wolf, â€œlittle naked son of mine. For, listen, child of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.â€ â€œI will surely come,â€ said Mowgli. â€œAnd when I come it will be to lay out Shere Khanâ€™s hide upon the Council Rock.
Do not forget me! Tell them in the jungle never to forget me!â€ The dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside alone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.
Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack      As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled         Once, twice and again! And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up      From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup.
This I, scouting alone, beheld,         Once, twice and again! As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled         Once, twice and again! And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back      To carry the word to the waiting pack,      And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track         Once, twice and again! As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled         Once, twice and again! Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!
Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark!
Tongue--give tongue to it! Hark!
O hark!
Once, twice and again!
Kaaâ€™s Hunting His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffaloâ€™s pride. Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide. If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore; Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons before. Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother, For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.
â€œThere is none like to me!â€ says the Cub in the pride of his earliest kill; But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him think and be still.
_ Maxims of Baloo_ All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle.
The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat the Hunting Verse--â€œFeet that make no noise; eyes that can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.â€ But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the dayâ€™s lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them.
None of the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangersâ€™ Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, â€œGive me leave to hunt here because I am hungry.â€ And the answer is, â€œHunt then for food, but not for pleasure.â€ All this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he grew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times.
But, as Baloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off in a temper, â€œA manâ€™s cub is a manâ€™s cub, and he must learn all the Law of the Jungle.â€ â€œBut think how small he is,â€ said the Black Panther, who would have spoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way.
â€œHow can his little head carry all thy long talk?â€ â€œIs there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No.
That is why I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly, when he forgets.â€ â€œSoftly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?â€ Bagheera grunted. â€œHis face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.â€ â€œBetter he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than that he should come to harm through ignorance,â€ Baloo answered very earnestly.
â€œI am now teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that shall protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all that hunt on four feet, except his own pack. He can now claim protection, if he will only remember the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that worth a little beating?â€ â€œWell, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub. He is no tree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon.
But what are those Master Words?
I am more likely to give help than to ask itâ€--Bagheera stretched out one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end of it--â€œstill I should like to know.â€ â€œI will call Mowgli and he shall say them--if he will.
Come, Little Brother!â€ â€œMy head is ringing like a bee tree,â€ said a sullen little voice over their heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant, adding as he reached the ground: â€œI come for Bagheera and not for thee, fat old Baloo!â€ â€œThat is all one to me,â€ said Baloo, though he was hurt and grieved. â€œTell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught thee this day.â€ â€œMaster Words for which people?â€ said Mowgli, delighted to show off. â€œThe jungle has many tongues. I know them all.â€ â€œA little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank their teacher.
Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank old Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People, then--great scholar.â€ â€œWe be of one blood, ye and I,â€ said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear accent which all the Hunting People use.
â€œGood. Now for the birds.â€ Mowgli repeated, with the Kiteâ€™s whistle at the end of the sentence. â€œNow for the Snake-People,â€ said Bagheera.
The answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his feet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped on to Bagheeraâ€™s back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on the glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at Baloo.
â€œThere--there! That was worth a little bruise,â€ said the brown bear tenderly. â€œSome day thou wilt remember me.â€ Then he turned aside to tell Bagheera how he had begged the Master Words from Hathi the Wild Elephant, who knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken Mowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a water-snake, because Baloo could not pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe against all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor beast would hurt him. â€œNo one then is to be feared,â€ Baloo wound up, patting his big furry stomach with pride.
â€œExcept his own tribe,â€ said Bagheera, under his breath; and then aloud to Mowgli, â€œHave a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this dancing up and down?â€ Mowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheeraâ€™s shoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him he was shouting at the top of his voice, â€œAnd so I shall have a tribe of my own, and lead them through the branches all day long.â€ â€œWhat is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?â€ said Bagheera.
â€œYes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,â€ Mowgli went on. â€œThey have promised me this.
Ah!â€ â€œWhoof!â€ Balooâ€™s big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheeraâ€™s back, and as the boy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.
â€œMowgli,â€ said Baloo, â€œthou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the Monkey People.â€ Mowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and Bagheeraâ€™s eyes were as hard as jade stones. â€œThou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people without a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.â€ â€œWhen Baloo hurt my head,â€ said Mowgli (he was still on his back), â€œI went away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on me. No one else cared.â€ He snuffled a little. â€œThe pity of the Monkey People!â€ Baloo snorted.
â€œThe stillness of the mountain stream!
The cool of the summer sun!
And then, man-cub?â€ â€œAnd then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and they--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said I was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their leader some day.â€ â€œThey have no leader,â€ said Bagheera. â€œThey lie. They have always lied.â€ â€œThey were very kind and bade me come again.
Why have I never been taken among the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day.
Let me get up! Bad Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again.â€ â€œListen, man-cub,â€ said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night. â€œI have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.
They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own, but use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep, and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way.
They are without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten.
We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever heard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?â€ â€œNo,â€ said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo had finished. â€œThe Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds.
They are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.â€ He had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.
â€œThe Monkey-People are forbidden,â€ said Baloo, â€œforbidden to the Jungle-People. Remember.â€ â€œForbidden,â€ said Bagheera, â€œbut I still think Baloo should have warned thee against them.â€ â€œI--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt.
The Monkey People! Faugh!â€ A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking Mowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross each otherâ€™s path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks and nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed.
Then they would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the Jungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because their memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they compromised things by making up a saying, â€œWhat the Bandar-log think now the jungle will think later,â€ and that comforted them a great deal. None of the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was. They never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea, and he told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in the tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection from the wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him teach them.
Of course Mowgli, as a woodcutterâ€™s child, inherited all sorts of instincts, and used to make little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees, considered his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were really going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the jungle--so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore they followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very quietly till it was time for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was very much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear, resolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.
The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and arms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash of branches in his face, and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo woke the jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk with every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled away to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting: â€œHe has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us.
All the Jungle-People admire us for our skill and our cunning.â€ Then they began their flight; and the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of the things nobody can describe. They have their regular roads and crossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy or a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at night if necessary. Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under the arms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a bound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the boyâ€™s weight held them back.
Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he could not help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down below frightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing over nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth. His escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop would fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring up, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next tree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green jungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea, and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face, and he and his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and crashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept along the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.
For a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew better than to struggle, and then he began to think. The first thing was to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys were going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless to look down, for he could only see the topsides of the branches, so he stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing and wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die.
Rann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He whistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and heard him give the Kite call for--â€œWe be of one blood, thou and I.â€  The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to the next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. â€œMark my trail!â€ Mowgli shouted. â€œTell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera of the Council Rock.â€ â€œIn whose name, Brother?â€ Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of course he had heard of him.
â€œMowgli, the Frog.
Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!â€ The last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but Rann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust, and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the treetops as Mowgliâ€™s escort whirled along. â€œThey never go far,â€ he said with a chuckle. â€œThey never do what they set out to do.
Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log.
This time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for themselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill more than goats.â€ So he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited. Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera climbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark. â€œWhy didst thou not warn the man-cub?â€ he roared to poor Baloo, who had set off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys.
â€œWhat was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him?â€ â€œHaste! O haste!
We--we may catch them yet!â€ Baloo panted. â€œAt that speed!
It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the Law--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee open. Sit still and think! Make a plan.
This is no time for chasing. They may drop him if we follow too close.â€ â€œArrula! Whoo!
They may have dropped him already, being tired of carrying him. Who can trust the Bandar-log?
Put dead bats on my head! Give me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees that I may be stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most miserable of bears!
Arulala!
Wahooa!
O Mowgli, Mowgli!
Why did I not warn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now perhaps I may have knocked the dayâ€™s lesson out of his mind, and he will be alone in the jungle without the Master Words.â€ Baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning. â€œAt least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago,â€ said Bagheera impatiently. â€œBaloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect.
What would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?â€ â€œWhat do I care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now.â€ â€œUnless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or kill him out of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He is wise and well taught, and above all he has the eyes that make the Jungle-People afraid. But (and it is a great evil) he is in the power of the Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have no fear of any of our people.â€ Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.
â€œFool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am,â€ said Baloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, â€œit is true what Hathi the Wild Elephant says: `To each his own fearâ€™; and they, the Bandar-log, fear Kaa the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as they can. He steals the young monkeys in the night.
The whisper of his name makes their wicked tails cold. Let us go to Kaa.â€ â€œWhat will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and with most evil eyes,â€ said Bagheera. â€œHe is very old and very cunning.
Above all, he is always hungry,â€ said Baloo hopefully. â€œPromise him many goats.â€ â€œHe sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep now, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?â€  Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.
â€œThen in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see reason.â€ Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the Panther, and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python. They found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun, admiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in retirement for the last ten days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting his big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet of his body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his lips as he thought of his dinner to come.
â€œHe has not eaten,â€ said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as he saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket. â€œBe careful, Bagheera!
He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and very quick to strike.â€ Kaa was not a poison snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes as cowards--but his strength lay in his hug, and when he had once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said. â€œGood hunting!â€ cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches. Like all snakes of his breed Kaa was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at first. Then he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered.
â€œGood hunting for us all,â€ he answered. â€œOho, Baloo, what dost thou do here? Good hunting, Bagheera.
One of us at least needs food. Is there any news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck?
I am as empty as a dried well.â€ â€œWe are hunting,â€ said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry Kaa. He is too big.
â€œGive me permission to come with you,â€ said Kaa.
â€œA blow more or less is nothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for days in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a young ape. Psshaw!
The branches are not what they were when I was young. Rotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.â€ â€œMaybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,â€ said Baloo. â€œI am a fair length--a fair length,â€ said Kaa with a little pride. â€œBut for all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very near to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the Bandar-log, and they called me most evil names.â€ â€œFootless, yellow earth-worm,â€ said Bagheera under his whiskers, as though he were trying to remember something.
â€œSssss!
Have they ever called me that?â€ said Kaa.
â€œSomething of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we never noticed them.
They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because (they are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid of the he-goatâ€™s horns,â€ Bagheera went on sweetly. Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows that he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of Kaaâ€™s throat ripple and bulge. â€œThe Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,â€ he said quietly. â€œWhen I came up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.â€ â€œIt--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,â€ said Baloo, but the words stuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the monkeys.
â€œBeyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the Bandar-log,â€ Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity. â€œIndeed,â€ Baloo began, â€œI am no more than the old and sometimes very foolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera here--â€ â€œIs Bagheera,â€ said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap, for he did not believe in being humble. â€œThe trouble is this, Kaa.
Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard.â€ â€œI heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told.â€ â€œBut it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,â€ said Baloo.
â€œThe best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides, I--we--love him, Kaa.â€ â€œTs! Ts!â€ said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. â€œI also have known what love is. There are tales I could tell that--â€ â€œThat need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,â€  said Bagheera quickly. â€œOur man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.â€ â€œThey fear me alone.
They have good reason,â€ said Kaa.
â€œChattering, foolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys. But a man-thing in their hands is in no good luck.
They grow tired of the nuts they pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning to do great things with it, and then they snap it in two. That man-thing is not to be envied.
They called me also--`yellow fishâ€™ was it not?â€ â€œWorm--worm--earth-worm,â€ said Bagheera, â€œas well as other things which I cannot now say for shame.â€ â€œWe must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp!
We must help their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?â€ â€œThe jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,â€ said Baloo. â€œWe had thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.â€ â€œI? How?
I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the Bandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.â€ â€œUp, Up!
Up, Up!
Hillo!
Illo!
Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf Pack!â€ Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the Kite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his wings. It was near Rannâ€™s bedtime, but he had ranged all over the jungle looking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage. â€œWhat is it?â€ said Baloo.
â€œI have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He bade me tell you. I watched. The Bandar-log have taken him beyond the river to the monkey city--to the Cold Lairs.
They may stay there for a night, or ten nights, or an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is my message. Good hunting, all you below!â€ â€œFull gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,â€ cried Bagheera.
â€œI will remember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O best of kites!â€ â€œIt is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could have done no less,â€ and Rann circled up again to his roost. â€œHe has not forgotten to use his tongue,â€ said Baloo with a chuckle of pride.
â€œTo think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the birds too while he was being pulled across trees!â€ â€œIt was most firmly driven into him,â€ said Bagheera. â€œBut I am proud of him, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.â€ They all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever went there, because what they called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted city, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that men have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not.
Besides, the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs held a little water. [Illustration: The â€œCold Lairsâ€] â€œIt is half a nightâ€™s journey--at full speed,â€ said Bagheera, and Baloo looked very serious. â€œI will go as fast as I can,â€ he said anxiously. â€œWe dare not wait for thee.
Follow, Baloo. We must go on the quick-foot--Kaa and I.â€ â€œFeet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four,â€ said Kaa shortly. Baloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and so they left him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the quick panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the huge Rock-python held level with him.
When they came to a hill stream, Bagheera gained, because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and two feet of his neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up the distance. â€œBy the Broken Lock that freed me,â€ said Bagheera, when twilight had fallen, â€œthou art no slow goer!â€ â€œI am hungry,â€ said Kaa. â€œBesides, they called me speckled frog.â€ â€œWorm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot.â€ â€œAll one. Let us go on,â€ and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the ground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and keeping to it. In the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgliâ€™s friends at all.
They had brought the boy to the Lost City, and were very much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an Indian city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long ago on a little hill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the ruined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted hinges.
Trees had grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were tumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of the towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps. A great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the courtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red and green, and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the kingâ€™s elephants used to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees. From the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness; the shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where four roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public wells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting on their sides.
The monkeys called the place their city, and pretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest. And yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to use them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the kingâ€™s council chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run in and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old bricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the terraces of the kingâ€™s garden, where they would shake the rose trees and the oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They explored all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of little dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what they had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling each other that they were doing as men did.
They drank at the tanks and made the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they would all rush together in mobs and shout: â€œThere is no one in the jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the Bandar-log.â€ Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city and went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice them. Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like or understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold Lairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli would have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs.
One of the monkeys made a speech and told his companions that Mowgliâ€™s capture marked a new thing in the history of the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks and canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked up some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began to pull their friendsâ€™ tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing. â€œI wish to eat,â€ said Mowgli. â€œI am a stranger in this part of the jungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.â€ Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild pawpaws.
But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit.
Mowgli was sore and angry as well as hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the Strangersâ€™ Hunting Call from time to time, but no one answered him, and Mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed. â€œAll that Baloo has said about the Bandar-log is true,â€ he thought to himself. â€œThey have no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish words and little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here, it will be all my own fault.
But I must try to return to my own jungle.
Baloo will surely beat me, but that is better than chasing silly rose leaves with the Bandar-log.â€ No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back, telling him that he did not know how happy he was, and pinching him to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but went with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for queens dead a hundred years ago.
The domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble tracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black velvet embroidery.
Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he was to wish to leave them. â€œWe are great. We are free.
We are wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and so it must be true,â€ they shouted.
â€œNow as you are a new listener and can carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us in future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves.â€ Mowgli made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the Bandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together: â€œThis is true; we all say so.â€ Mowgli nodded and blinked, and said â€œYesâ€ when they asked him a question, and his head spun with the noise. â€œTabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these people,â€ he said to himself, â€œand now they have madness. Certainly this is _dewanee_, the madness. Do they never go to sleep?
Now there is a cloud coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might try to run away in the darkness. But I am tired.â€ That same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined ditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run any risks.
The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and few in the jungle care for those odds. â€œI will go to the west wall,â€ Kaa whispered, â€œand come down swiftly with the slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds, but--â€ â€œI know it,â€ said Bagheera. â€œWould that Baloo were here, but we must do what we can.
When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace. They hold some sort of council there over the boy.â€ â€œGood hunting,â€ said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That happened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed awhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon, and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheeraâ€™s light feet on the terrace.
The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost without a sound and was striking--he knew better than to waste time in biting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli in circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage, and then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him, a monkey shouted: â€œThere is only one here! Kill him!
Kill.â€ A scuffling mass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over Bagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up the wall of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome. A man-trained boy would have been badly bruised, for the fall was a good fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and landed on his feet. â€œStay there,â€ shouted the monkeys, â€œtill we have killed thy friends, and later we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.â€ â€œWe be of one blood, ye and I,â€ said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snakeâ€™s Call. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him and gave the Call a second time, to make sure.
â€œEven ssso!
Down hoods all!â€ said half a dozen low voices (every ruin in India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old summerhouse was alive with cobras). â€œStand still, Little Brother, for thy feet may do us harm.â€ Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and listening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther--the yells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheeraâ€™s deep, hoarse cough as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his enemies. For the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for his life.
â€œBaloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,â€ Mowgli thought. And then he called aloud: â€œTo the tank, Bagheera.
Roll to the water tanks.
Roll and plunge! Get to the water!â€ Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new courage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo.
The old Bear had done his best, but he could not come before. â€œBagheera,â€ he shouted, â€œI am here. I climb! I haste!
Ahuwora!
The stones slip under my feet! Wait my coming, O most infamous Bandar-log!â€ He panted up the terrace only to disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself squarely on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as many as he could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat, like the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told Mowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys could not follow.
The Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just out of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps, dancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon him from all sides if he came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his dripping chin, and in despair gave the Snakeâ€™s Call for protection--â€œWe be of one blood, ye and Iâ€--for he believed that Kaa had turned tail at the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on the edge of the terrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black Panther asking for help. Kaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch.
He had no intention of losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself once or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in working order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to and fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of the Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their comrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the day birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill.
The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can imagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five feet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His first stroke was delivered into the heart of the crowd round Baloo.
It was sent home with shut mouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys scattered with cries of--â€œKaa! It is Kaa!
Run!
Run!â€ Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories their elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who could slip along the branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead branch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived, till the branch caught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle, for none of them knew the limits of his power, none of them could look him in the face, and none had ever come alive out of his hug. And so they ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the houses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief.
His fur was much thicker than Bagheeraâ€™s, but he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word, and the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed where they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled under them. The monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped their cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard Bagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank.
Then the clamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they skipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse, put his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his front teeth, to show his derision and contempt.
â€œGet the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,â€ Bagheera gasped. â€œLet us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again.â€ â€œThey will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!â€ Kaa hissed, and the city was silent once more. â€œI could not come before, Brother, but I think I heard thee callâ€--this was to Bagheera.
â€œI--I may have cried out in the battle,â€ Bagheera answered. â€œBaloo, art thou hurt? â€œI am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little bearlings,â€ said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other.
â€œWow!
I am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I.â€ â€œNo matter. Where is the manling?â€ â€œHere, in a trap. I cannot climb out,â€ cried Mowgli.
The curve of the broken dome was above his head. â€œTake him away.
He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our young,â€ said the cobras inside.
â€œHah!â€ said Kaa with a chuckle, â€œhe has friends everywhere, this manling. Stand back, manling.
And hide you, O Poison People. I break down the wall.â€ Kaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble tracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear of the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows, nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck. â€œArt thou hurt?â€ said Baloo, hugging him softly. â€œI am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised.
But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my Brothers!
Ye bleed.â€ â€œOthers also,â€ said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the monkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.
â€œIt is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all little frogs!â€ whimpered Baloo.
â€œOf that we shall judge later,â€ said Bagheera, in a dry voice that Mowgli did not at all like. â€œBut here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli.â€ Mowgli turned and saw the great Pythonâ€™s head swaying a foot above his own. â€œSo this is the manling,â€ said Kaa.
â€œVery soft is his skin, and he is not unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.â€ â€œWe be one blood, thou and I,â€ Mowgli answered. â€œI take my life from thee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.â€ â€œAll thanks, Little Brother,â€ said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled.
â€œAnd what may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he goes abroad.â€ â€œI kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can use them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth.
I have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art in a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.â€ â€œWell said,â€ growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgliâ€™s shoulder. â€œA brave heart and a courteous tongue,â€ said he. â€œThey shall carry thee far through the jungle, manling.
But now go hence quickly with thy friends.
Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it is not well that thou shouldst see.â€ The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera began to put his fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the terrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all the monkeysâ€™ eyes upon him. â€œThe moon sets,â€ he said. â€œIs there yet light enough to see?â€ From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--â€œWe see, O Kaa.â€ â€œGood.
Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still and watch.â€ He turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right to left. Then he began making loops and figures of eight with his body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided figures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never stopping his low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last the dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle of the scales.
Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats, their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.
â€œBandar-log,â€ said the voice of Kaa at last, â€œcan ye stir foot or hand without my order? Speak!â€ â€œWithout thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!â€ â€œGood! Come all one pace nearer to me.â€ The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and Bagheera took one stiff step forward with them.
â€œNearer!â€ hissed Kaa, and they all moved again. Mowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the two great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.
â€œKeep thy hand on my shoulder,â€ Bagheera whispered. â€œKeep it there, or I must go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!â€ â€œIt is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,â€ said Mowgli. â€œLet us go.â€ And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.
â€œWhoof!â€ said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. â€œNever more will I make an ally of Kaa,â€ and he shook himself all over. â€œHe knows more than we,â€ said Bagheera, trembling.
â€œIn a little time, had I stayed, I should have walked down his throat.â€ â€œMany will walk by that road before the moon rises again,â€ said Baloo. â€œHe will have good hunting--after his own fashion.â€ â€œBut what was the meaning of it all?â€ said Mowgli, who did not know anything of a pythonâ€™s powers of fascination. â€œI saw no more than a big snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all sore.
Ho!
Ho!â€ â€œMowgli,â€ said Bagheera angrily, â€œhis nose was sore on thy account, as my ears and sides and paws, and Balooâ€™s neck and shoulders are bitten on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with pleasure for many days.â€ â€œIt is nothing,â€ said Baloo; â€œwe have the man-cub again.â€ â€œTrue, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and last of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black Panther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I were both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this, man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log.â€ â€œTrue, it is true,â€ said Mowgli sorrowfully. â€œI am an evil man-cub, and my stomach is sad in me.â€ â€œMf!
What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?â€ Baloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: â€œSorrow never stays punishment. But remember, Bagheera, he is very little.â€ â€œI will remember.
But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now.
Mowgli, hast thou anything to say?â€ â€œNothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded.
It is just.â€ Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a pantherâ€™s point of view (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself up without a word.
â€œNow,â€ said Bagheera, â€œjump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go home.â€ One of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores. There is no nagging afterward. Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheeraâ€™s back and slept so deeply that he never waked when he was put down in the home-cave.
Road-Song of the Bandar-Log      Here we go in a flung festoon,      Half-way up to the jealous moon!
Donâ€™t you envy our pranceful bands?
Donâ€™t you wish you had extra hands?
Wouldnâ€™t you like if your tails were--so--      Curved in the shape of a Cupidâ€™s bow? Now youâ€™re angry, but--never mind,         _ Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!_ Here we sit in a branchy row,      Thinking of beautiful things we know;      Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,      All complete, in a minute or two--      Something noble and wise and good,      Done by merely wishing we could. Weâ€™ve forgotten, but--never mind,         _Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!_      All the talk we ever have heard      Uttered by bat or beast or bird--      Hide or fin or scale or feather--      Jabber it quickly and all together! Excellent!
Wonderful!
Once again!
Now we are talking just like men!
Letâ€™s pretend we are ... never mind,         _Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!_ This is the way of the Monkey-kind.
_Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,      That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings. By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,      Be sure, be sure, weâ€™re going to do some splendid things!_ â€œTiger! Tiger!â€      What of the hunting, hunter bold?
Brother, the watch was long and cold. What of the quarry ye went to kill? Brother, he crops in the jungle still.
Where is the power that made your pride?
Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side. Where is the haste that ye hurry by?
Brother, I go to my lair--to die. Now we must go back to the first tale.
When Mowgli left the wolfâ€™s cave after the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he went down to the plowed lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop there because it was too near to the jungle, and he knew that he had made at least one bad enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to the rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady jog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he came to a country that he did not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with rocks and cut up by ravines.
At one end stood a little village, and at the other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds, and stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the plain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in charge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow pariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked on, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village gate he saw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight, pushed to one side.
â€œUmph!â€ he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade in his night rambles after things to eat. â€œSo men are afraid of the People of the Jungle here also.â€ He sat down by the gate, and when a man came out he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to show that he wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the village shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in white, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. The priest came to the gate, and with him at least a hundred people, who stared and talked and shouted and pointed at Mowgli.
â€œThey have no manners, these Men Folk,â€ said Mowgli to himself.
â€œOnly the gray ape would behave as they do.â€ So he threw back his long hair and frowned at the crowd. â€œWhat is there to be afraid of?â€ said the priest. â€œLook at the marks on his arms and legs.
They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child run away from the jungle.â€ Of course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder than they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and legs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these bites, for he knew what real biting meant.
â€œArre!
Arre!â€ said two or three women together.
â€œTo be bitten by wolves, poor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire.
By my honor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger.â€ â€œLet me look,â€ said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and ankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. â€œIndeed he is not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.â€ The priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the richest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a minute and said solemnly: â€œWhat the jungle has taken the jungle has restored.
Take the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the priest who sees so far into the lives of men.â€ â€œBy the Bull that bought me,â€ said Mowgli to himself, â€œbut all this talking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a man I must become.â€ The crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there was a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny raised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a Hindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such as they sell at the country fairs. She gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her hand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that he might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had taken him. So she said, â€œNathoo, O Nathoo!â€ Mowgli did not show that he knew the name. â€œDost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new shoes?â€ She touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn.
â€œNo,â€  she said sorrowfully, â€œthose feet have never worn shoes, but thou art very like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.â€ Mowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as he looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he wanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings.
â€œWhat is the good of a man,â€ he said to himself at last, â€œif he does not understand manâ€™s talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the jungle. I must speak their talk.â€ It was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to imitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little wild pig.
So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate it almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many things in the hut. There was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under anything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they shut the door he went through the window. â€œGive him his will,â€ said Messuaâ€™s husband. â€œRemember he can never till now have slept on a bed. If he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away.â€ So Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of the field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him under the chin.
â€œPhew!â€ said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolfâ€™s cubs).
â€œThis is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest of wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already.
Wake, Little Brother; I bring news.â€ â€œAre all well in the jungle?â€ said Mowgli, hugging him. â€œAll except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now, listen. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows again, for he is badly singed.
When he returns he swears that he will lay thy bones in the Waingunga.â€ â€œThere are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But news is always good.
I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things, Gray Brother,--but bring me the news always.â€ â€œThou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee forget?â€ said Gray Brother anxiously. â€œNever.
I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave.
But also I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.â€ â€œAnd that thou mayest be cast out of another pack.
Men are only men, Little Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When I come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge of the grazing-ground.â€ For three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village gate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had to wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had to learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and about plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children in the village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had taught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on keeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not play games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the knowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him from picking them up and breaking them in two.
He did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he was weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that he was as strong as a bull. And Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes between man and man. When the potterâ€™s donkey slipped in the clay pit, Mowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their journey to the market at Khanhiwara.
That was very shocking, too, for the potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest scolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the priest told Messuaâ€™s husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as soon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would have to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they grazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he had been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off to a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great fig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and the barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the village hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys sat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the platform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk every night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree and talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into the night.
They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and Buldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the jungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged out of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle was always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their crops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within sight of the village gates. Mowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of, had to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo, the Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story to another, and Mowgliâ€™s shoulders shook.
Buldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messuaâ€™s son was a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked, old money-lender, who had died some years ago. â€œAnd I know that this is true,â€ he said, â€œbecause Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he got in a riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I speak of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal.â€ â€œTrue, true, that must be the truth,â€ said the gray-beards, nodding together. â€œAre all these tales such cobwebs and moontalk?â€ said Mowgli.
â€œThat tiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the soul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal is childâ€™s talk.â€ Buldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man stared.
â€œOho!
It is the jungle brat, is it?â€ said Buldeo. â€œIf thou art so wise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set a hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders speak.â€ Mowgli rose to go.
â€œAll the evening I have lain here listening,â€ he called back over his shoulder, â€œand, except once or twice, Buldeo has not said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his very doors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and goblins which he says he has seen?â€ â€œIt is full time that boy went to herding,â€ said the head-man, while Buldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgliâ€™s impertinence. The custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle and buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back at night.
The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow themselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that hardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds they are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But if they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes carried off.
Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting on the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes, with their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their byres, one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to the children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with a long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the cattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be very careful not to stray away from the herd.
An Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little ravines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes generally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing or basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge of the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped from Ramaâ€™s neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother. â€œAh,â€ said Gray Brother, â€œI have waited here very many days.
What is the meaning of this cattle-herding work?â€ â€œIt is an order,â€ said Mowgli. â€œI am a village herd for a while. What news of Shere Khan?â€ â€œHe has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for thee.
Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to kill thee.â€ â€œVery good,â€ said Mowgli.
â€œSo long as he is away do thou or one of the four brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of the village.
When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the _dhÃ¢k_ tree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khanâ€™s mouth.â€ Then Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while the buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest things in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move on again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes very seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after another, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and staring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like logs.
The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children hear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead, and they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep down, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and the next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be a score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and wake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put grasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight; or string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard basking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they sing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and the day seems longer than most peopleâ€™s whole lives, and perhaps they make a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and put reeds into the menâ€™s hands, and pretend that they are kings and the figures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped.
Then evening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of the sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other, and they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village lights. Day after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and day after day he would see Gray Brotherâ€™s back a mile and a half away across the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day after day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him, and dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false step with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would have heard him in those long, still mornings. At last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place, and he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree, which was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother, every bristle on his back lifted.
â€œHe has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed the ranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,â€ said the Wolf, panting. Mowgli frowned.
â€œI am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very cunning.â€ â€œHave no fear,â€ said Gray Brother, licking his lips a little. â€œI met Tabaqui in the dawn. Now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites, but he told me everything before I broke his back. Shere Khanâ€™s plan is to wait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee and for no one else. He is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the Waingunga.â€ â€œHas he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?â€ said Mowgli, for the answer meant life and death to him.
â€œHe killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan could never fast, even for the sake of revenge.â€ â€œOh! Fool, fool!
What a cubâ€™s cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he thinks that I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does he lie up? If there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies.
These buffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot speak their language. Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?â€ â€œHe swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,â€ said Gray Brother.
â€œTabaqui told him that, I know. He would never have thought of it alone.â€ Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth, thinking. â€œThe big ravine of the Waingunga.
That opens out on the plain not half a mile from here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of the ravine and then sweep down--but he would slink out at the foot. We must block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for me?â€ â€œNot I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.â€ Gray Brother trotted off and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that Mowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry of all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.
â€œAkela!
Akela!â€ said Mowgli, clapping his hands. â€œI might have known that thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand.
Cut the herd in two, Akela.
Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and the plow buffaloes by themselves.â€ The two wolves ran, ladiesâ€™-chain fashion, in and out of the herd, which snorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps. In one, the cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared and pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and trample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls snorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much less dangerous, for they had no calves to protect.
No six men could have divided the herd so neatly. â€œWhat orders!â€ panted Akela. â€œThey are trying to join again.â€ Mowgli slipped on to Ramaâ€™s back. â€œDrive the bulls away to the left, Akela.
Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive them into the foot of the ravine.â€ â€œHow far?â€ said Gray Brother, panting and snapping. â€œTill the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump,â€ shouted Mowgli. â€œKeep them there till we come down.â€ The bulls swept off as Akela bayed, and Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged down on him, and he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela drove the bulls far to the left.
â€œWell done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful, now--careful, Akela.
A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah!
This is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these creatures could move so swiftly?â€ Mowgli called.
â€œI have--have hunted these too in my time,â€ gasped Akela in the dust. â€œShall I turn them into the jungle?â€ â€œAy!
Turn.
Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only tell him what I need of him to-day.â€ The bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the standing thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half a mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry them, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.
But Mowgliâ€™s plan was simple enough.
All he wanted to do was to make a big circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the bulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for he knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in any condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was soothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the rear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a long, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and give Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd at the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to the ravine itself.
From that height you could see across the tops of the trees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides of the ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they ran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung over them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out. â€œLet them breathe, Akela,â€ he said, holding up his hand. â€œThey have not winded him yet. Let them breathe.
I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We have him in the trap.â€ He put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost like shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock. After a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a full-fed tiger just wakened. â€œWho calls?â€ said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of the ravine screeching.
â€œI, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!
Down--hurry them down, Akela!
Down, Rama, down!â€ The herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave tongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the other, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up round them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before they were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and bellowed.
â€œHa! Ha!â€ said Mowgli, on his back.
â€œNow thou knowest!â€ and the torrent of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the ravine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being shouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand. Shere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on, heavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do anything rather than fight.
The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their calves), and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and slipped off Ramaâ€™s neck, laying about him right and left with his stick. â€œQuick, Akela!
Break them up.
Scatter them, or they will be fighting one another. Drive them away, Akela. Hai, Rama!
Hai, hai, hai! my children.
Softly now, softly!
It is all over.â€ Akela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloesâ€™ legs, and though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli managed to turn Rama, and the others followed him to the wallows. Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were coming for him already. â€œBrothers, that was a dogâ€™s death,â€ said Mowgli, feeling for the knife he always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men.
â€œBut he would never have shown fight. His hide will look well on the Council Rock. We must get to work swiftly.â€ A boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot tiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animalâ€™s skin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work, and Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves lolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them.
Presently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with the Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo stampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct Mowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of sight as soon as they saw the man coming.
â€œWhat is this folly?â€ said Buldeo angrily. â€œTo think that thou canst skin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger too, and there is a hundred rupees on his head.
Well, well, we will overlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one of the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.â€  He fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to singe Shere Khanâ€™s whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tigerâ€™s whiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them. â€œHum!â€ said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a forepaw. â€œSo thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and perhaps give me one rupee?
Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for my own use. Heh!
Old man, take away that fire!â€ â€œWhat talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the stupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill.
The tiger has just fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst not even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo, must be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one anna of the reward, but only a very big beating.
Leave the carcass!â€ â€œBy the Bull that bought me,â€ said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the shoulder, â€œmust I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela, this man plagues me.â€ Buldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khanâ€™s head, found himself sprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli went on skinning as though he were alone in all India.
â€œYe-es,â€ he said, between his teeth. â€œThou art altogether right, Buldeo.
Thou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war between this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won.â€ To do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have taken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf who obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating tigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind, thought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would protect him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see Mowgli turn into a tiger too.
â€œMaharaj! Great King,â€ he said at last in a husky whisper.
â€œYes,â€ said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little. â€œI am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a herdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to pieces?â€ â€œGo, and peace go with thee.
Only, another time do not meddle with my game. Let him go, Akela.â€ Buldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back over his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible. When he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and sorcery that made the priest look very grave. Mowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and the wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.
â€œNow we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd them, Akela.â€ The herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the village Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the temple blowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him by the gate.
â€œThat is because I have killed Shere Khan,â€ he said to himself. But a shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the villagers shouted: â€œSorcerer!
Wolfâ€™s brat!
Jungle demon!
Go away!
Get hence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot, Buldeo, shoot!â€ The old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed in pain. â€œMore sorcery!â€ shouted the villagers. â€œHe can turn bullets.
Buldeo, that was thy buffalo.â€ â€œNow what is this?â€ said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker. â€œThey are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,â€ said Akela, sitting down composedly. â€œIt is in my head that, if bullets mean anything, they would cast thee out.â€ â€œWolf! Wolfâ€™s cub! Go away!â€ shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the sacred tulsi plant.
â€œAgain?
Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I am a wolf. Let us go, Akela.â€ A woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: â€œOh, my son, my son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast at will.
I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo says thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathooâ€™s death.â€ â€œCome back, Messua!â€ shouted the crowd. â€œCome back, or we will stone thee.â€ Mowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in the mouth. â€œRun back, Messua.
This is one of the foolish tales they tell under the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy sonâ€™s life. Farewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly than their brickbats.
I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!â€ â€œNow, once more, Akela,â€ he cried. â€œBring the herd in.â€ The buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly needed Akelaâ€™s yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind, scattering the crowd right and left. â€œKeep count!â€ shouted Mowgli scornfully.
â€œIt may be that I have stolen one of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you well, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my wolves and hunt you up and down your street.â€ He turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he looked up at the stars he felt happy. â€œNo more sleeping in traps for me, Akela.
Let us get Shere Khanâ€™s skin and go away. No, we will not hurt the village, for Messua was kind to me.â€ When the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the horrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a bundle on his head, trotting across at the steady wolfâ€™s trot that eats up the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew the conches louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered the story of his adventures in the jungle, till he ended by saying that Akela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man.
The moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the hill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolfâ€™s cave. â€œThey have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,â€ shouted Mowgli, â€œbut I come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.â€ Mother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and her eyes glowed as she saw the skin. â€œI told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into this cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter would be the hunted.
It is well done.â€ â€œLittle Brother, it is well done,â€ said a deep voice in the thicket. â€œWe were lonely in the jungle without thee,â€ and Bagheera came running to Mowgliâ€™s bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and Mowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit, and pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon it, and called the old call to the Council, â€œLook--look well, O Wolves,â€  exactly as he had called when Mowgli was first brought there.
Ever since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader, hunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered the call from habit; and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen into, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating bad food, and many were missing.
But they came to the Council Rock, all that were left of them, and saw Shere Khanâ€™s striped hide on the rock, and the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet.
It was then that Mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all by itself, and he shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling skin, and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left, while Gray Brother and Akela howled between the verses. â€œLook well, O Wolves.
Have I kept my word?â€ said Mowgli. And the wolves bayed â€œYes,â€ and one tattered wolf howled: â€œLead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of this lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.â€ â€œNay,â€ purred Bagheera, â€œthat may not be. When ye are full-fed, the madness may come upon you again.
Not for nothing are ye called the Free People. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves.â€ â€œMan-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,â€ said Mowgli. â€œNow I will hunt alone in the jungle.â€ â€œAnd we will hunt with thee,â€ said the four cubs.
So Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from that day on. But he was not always alone, because, years afterward, he became a man and married.
But that is a story for grown-ups.
Mowgliâ€™s Song      THAT HE SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE      DANCED ON SHERE KHANâ€™S HIDE The Song of Mowgliâ€”I, Mowgli, am singing. Let the jungle listen to the things I have done. Shere Khan said he would killâ€”would kill! At the gates in the twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!
He ate and he drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou drink again?
Sleep and dream of the kill. I am alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother, come to me!
Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!
Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls with the angry eyes. Drive them to and fro as I order. Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan?
Wake, oh, wake!
Here come I, and the bulls are behind.
Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot. Waters of the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan? He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should fly. He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches. Little bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?
_ Ow!_ He is there. _Ahoo!_ He is there. Under the feet of Rama lies the Lame One!
Up, Shere Khan!
Up and kill! Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!
_ Hsh!_ He is asleep. We will not wake him, for his strength is very great. The kites have come down to see it. The black ants have come up to know it.
There is a great assembly in his honor.
_Alala!_ I have no cloth to wrap me. The kites will see that I am naked. I am ashamed to meet all these people.
Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend me thy gay striped coat that I may go to the Council Rock. By the Bull that bought me I made a promiseâ€”a little promise. Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.
With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the hunter, I will stoop down for my gift. Waters of the Waingunga, Shere Khan gives me his coat for the love that he bears me. Pull, Gray Brother!
Pull, Akela! Heavy is the hide of Shere Khan. The Man Pack are angry.
They throw stones and talk childâ€™s talk. My mouth is bleeding. Let me run away. Through the night, through the hot night, run swiftly with me, my brothers.
We will leave the lights of the village and go to the low moon. Waters of the Waingunga, the Man-Pack have cast me out. I did them no harm, but they were afraid of me. Why?
Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too. The jungle is shut to me and the village gates are shut.
Why?
As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the village and the jungle. Why?
I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy. My mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.
Why?
These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the spring. The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it falls. Why?
I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet. All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.
Lookâ€”look well, O Wolves!
_Ahae!_ My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand. The White Seal      Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,         And black are the waters that sparkled so green. The moon, oâ€™er the combers, looks downward to find us         At rest in the hollows that rustle between.
Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow,         Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!
The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,         Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas! Seal Lullaby All these things happened several years ago at a place called Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and away in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days till he was fit to fly back to St. Paulâ€™s again. Limmershin is a very quaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth.
Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people who have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea. For Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world. Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place he happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for Novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible.
Sea Catch was fifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights, but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face; then he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were firmly fixed on the other sealâ€™s neck, the other seal might get away if he could, but Sea Catch would not help him. Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules of the Beach.
He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach was something frightful.
From a little hill called Hutchinsonâ€™s Hill, you could look over three and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries, for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing that grew.
They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah alone. Sea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when Matkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea, and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his reservation, saying gruffly: â€œLate as usual.
Where have you been?â€ It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad. Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: â€œHow thoughtful of you. Youâ€™ve taken the old place again.â€ â€œI should think I had,â€ said Sea Catch.
â€œLook at me!â€ He was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out, and his sides were torn to ribbons.
â€œOh, you men, you men!â€ Matkah said, fanning herself with her hind flipper. â€œWhy canâ€™t you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You look as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.â€ â€œI havenâ€™t been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The beach is disgracefully crowded this season. Iâ€™ve met at least a hundred seals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting.
Why canâ€™t people stay where they belong?â€ â€œIâ€™ve often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter Island instead of this crowded place,â€ said Matkah. â€œBah!
Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they would say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.â€ Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended to go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a sharp lookout for a fight.
Now that all the seals and their wives were on the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the loudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals on the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie, fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing about in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at Novastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look all pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while. Kotick, Matkahâ€™s baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals must be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother look at him very closely.
â€œSea Catch,â€ she said, at last, â€œour babyâ€™s going to be white!â€ â€œEmpty clam-shells and dry seaweed!â€ snorted Sea Catch. â€œThere never has been such a thing in the world as a white seal.â€ â€œI canâ€™t help that,â€ said Matkah; â€œthereâ€™s going to be now.â€ And she sang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their babies:      You mustnâ€™t swim till youâ€™re six weeks old,         Or your head will be sunk by your heels;      And summer gales and Killer Whales         Are bad for baby seals. Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,         As bad as bad can be;      But splash and grow strong,      And you canâ€™t be wrong. Child of the Open Sea!
Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He paddled and scrambled about by his motherâ€™s side, and learned to scuffle out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days, but then he ate all he could and throve upon it. The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like puppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again.
The old people in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie kept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime. When Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until she heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head over heels right and left.
There were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and the babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, â€œSo long as you donâ€™t lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy sea, nothing will hurt you here.â€ Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy till they learn.
The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave carried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song, and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned. After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks learning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and out of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found that he truly belonged to the water. Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did; or playing â€œIâ€™m the King of the Castleâ€ on slippery, weedy rocks that just stuck out of the wash.
Now and then he would see a thin fin, like a big sharkâ€™s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all. Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paulâ€™s for the deep sea, by families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries, and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. â€œNext year,â€ said Matkah to Kotick, â€œyou will be a holluschickie; but this year you must learn how to catch fish.â€ They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the long, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all over, Matkah told him he was learning the â€œfeel of the water,â€ and that tingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard and get away.
â€œIn a little time,â€ she said, â€œyouâ€™ll know where to swim to, but just now weâ€™ll follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he is very wise.â€ A school of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little Kotick followed them as fast as he could. â€œHow do you know where to go to?â€ he panted. The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under. â€œMy tail tingles, youngster,â€ he said.
â€œThat means thereâ€™s a gale behind me.
Come along! When youâ€™re south of the Sticky Water [he meant the Equator] and your tail tingles, that means thereâ€™s a gale in front of you and you must head north. Come along!
The water feels bad here.â€ This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always learning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the under-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds; how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart like a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes ran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing all over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed Albatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers close to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone because they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at full speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a ship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing.
And all that time he never set flipper on dry ground. One day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles away, the games his companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the seal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming steadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for the same place, and they said: â€œGreeting, Kotick!
This year we are all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off Lukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?â€ Kotickâ€™s fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of it, he only said, â€œSwim quickly!
My bones are aching for the land.â€ And so they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist. That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what they had done while they had been at sea.
They talked about the Pacific as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie romped down from Hutchinsonâ€™s Hill crying: â€œOut of the way, youngsters! The sea is deep and you donâ€™t know all thatâ€™s in it yet. Wait till youâ€™ve rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white coat?â€ â€œI didnâ€™t get it,â€ said Kotick.
â€œIt grew.â€ And just as he was going to roll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man before, coughed and lowered his head. The holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick Booterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon, his son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea nurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the killing pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned into seal-skin jackets later on.
â€œHo!â€ said Patalamon.
â€œLook!
Thereâ€™s a white seal!â€ Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was an Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a prayer. â€œDonâ€™t touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal since--since I was born.
Perhaps it is old Zaharrofâ€™s ghost. He was lost last year in the big gale.â€ â€œIâ€™m not going near him,â€ said Patalamon.
â€œHeâ€™s unlucky. Do you really think he is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him for some gullsâ€™ eggs.â€ â€œDonâ€™t look at him,â€ said Kerick. â€œHead off that drove of four-year-olds.
The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but itâ€™s the beginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do. Quick!â€ Patalamon rattled a pair of sealâ€™s shoulder bones in front of a herd of holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing.
Then he stepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland, and they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went on playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions, and none of his companions could tell him anything, except that the men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every year.
â€œI am going to follow,â€ he said, and his eyes nearly popped out of his head as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd. â€œThe white seal is coming after us,â€ cried Patalamon. â€œThatâ€™s the first time a seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone.â€ â€œHsh! Donâ€™t look behind you,â€ said Kerick.
â€œIt is Zaharrofâ€™s ghost! I must speak to the priest about this.â€ The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an hour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they were skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lionâ€™s Neck, past Webster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering.
He thought that he was at the worldâ€™s end, but the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel. Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the fog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions or too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made of the skin of a walrusâ€™s throat, and then Kerick said, â€œLet go!â€ and then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.
Ten minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more, for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers, whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough for Kotick. He turned and galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for a short time) back to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with horror.
At Sea Lionâ€™s Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge of the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and rocked there, gasping miserably. â€œWhatâ€™s here?â€ said a sea lion gruffly, for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.
â€œScoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!â€ (â€œIâ€™m lonesome, very lonesome!â€) said Kotick.
â€œTheyâ€™re killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!â€ The Sea Lion turned his head inshore. â€œNonsense!â€ he said. â€œYour friends are making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick polishing off a drove.
Heâ€™s done that for thirty years.â€ â€œItâ€™s horrible,â€ said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him all standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock. â€œWell done for a yearling!â€ said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good swimming. â€œI suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it, but if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get to know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come you will always be driven.â€ â€œIsnâ€™t there any such island?â€ began Kotick. â€œIâ€™ve followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a fondness for talking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to Sea Vitch.
He may know something. Donâ€™t flounce off like that. Itâ€™s a six-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first, little one.â€ Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own beach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as seals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet of rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and rock and gullsâ€™ nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.
He landed close to old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is asleep--as he was then, with his hind flippers half in and half out of the surf. â€œWake up!â€ barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise. â€œHah!
Ho!
Hmph!
Whatâ€™s that?â€ said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next walrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the next, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction but the right one. â€œHi!
Itâ€™s me,â€ said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a little white slug. â€œWell!
May I be--skinned!â€ said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick as you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy.
Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just then; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: â€œIsnâ€™t there any place for seals to go where men donâ€™t ever come?â€ â€œGo and find out,â€ said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. â€œRun away. Weâ€™re busy here.â€ Kotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could: â€œClam-eater! Clam-eater!â€ He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to be a very terrible person.
Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies and the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the Puffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the cry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not have heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling and screaming â€œClam-eater! Stareek [old man]!â€ while Sea Vitch rolled from side to side grunting and coughing. â€œNow will you tell?â€ said Kotick, all out of breath. â€œGo and ask Sea Cow,â€ said Sea Vitch. â€œIf he is living still, heâ€™ll be able to tell you.â€ â€œHow shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him?â€ said Kotick, sheering off.
â€œHeâ€™s the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch,â€ screamed a Burgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitchâ€™s nose.
â€œUglier, and with worse manners!
Stareek!â€ Kotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover a quiet place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven the holluschickie--it was part of the dayâ€™s work--and that if he did not like to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds. But none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the difference between him and his friends.
Besides, Kotick was a white seal. â€œWhat you must do,â€ said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his sonâ€™s adventures, â€œis to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have a nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself.â€ Even gentle Matkah, his mother, said: â€œYou will never be able to stop the killing.
Go and play in the sea, Kotick.â€ And Kotick went off and danced the Fire-dance with a very heavy little heart. That autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone because of a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow, if there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not get at them.
So he explored and explored by himself from the North to the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day and a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island that he could fancy. If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play on, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down blubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that seals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again.
He picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that Kerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once been a seal nursery.
And it was so in all the other islands that he visited. Limmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five seasons exploring, with a four monthsâ€™ rest each year at Novastoshnah, when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary islands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator, where he was nearly baked to death; he went to the Georgia Islands, the Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Goughâ€™s Island, Bouvetâ€™s Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island south of the Cape of Good Hope.
But everywhere the People of the Sea told him the same things.
Seals had come to those islands once upon a time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that was when he was coming back from Goughâ€™s Island), he found a few hundred mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too. That nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his own beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of green trees, where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows. â€œNow,â€ said Kotick, â€œI am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens with the holluschickie I shall not care.â€ The old seal said, â€œTry once more.
I am the last of the Lost Rookery of Masafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand there was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come out of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old, and I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more.â€ And Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, â€œI am the only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.â€ This cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that summer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for he was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly white mane on his shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his father. â€œGive me another season,â€ he said. â€œRemember, Mother, it is always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.â€ Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put off marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with her all down Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last exploration.
This time he went westward, because he had fallen on the trail of a great shoal of halibut, and he needed at least one hundred pounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition. He chased them till he was tired, and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the hollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the coast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently bumped on a weed-bed, he said, â€œHm, tideâ€™s running strong tonight,â€ and turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched.
Then he jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds. â€œBy the Great Combers of Magellan!â€ he said, beneath his mustache.
â€œWho in the Deep Sea are these people?â€ They were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish, squid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between twenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a shovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet leather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw, and they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they werenâ€™t grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front flippers as a fat man waves his arm.
â€œAhem!â€ said Kotick.
â€œGood sport, gentlemen?â€ The big things answered by bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman.
When they began feeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces that they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into their mouths and chumped solemnly. â€œMessy style of feeding, that,â€ said Kotick. They bowed again, and Kotick began to lose his temper. â€œVery good,â€ he said.
â€œIf you do happen to have an extra joint in your front flipper you neednâ€™t show off so. I see you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.â€ The split lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did not speak. â€œWell!â€ said Kotick.
â€œYouâ€™re the only people Iâ€™ve ever met uglier than Sea Vitch--and with worse manners.â€ Then he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed to him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled backward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.
The sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed, and Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked up in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as human beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot talk.
He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven, and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even to his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.
By daylight Kotickâ€™s mane was standing on end and his temper was gone where the dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very slowly, stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and Kotick followed them, saying to himself, â€œPeople who are such idiots as these are would have been killed long ago if they hadnâ€™t found out some safe island. And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish theyâ€™d hurry.â€ It was weary work for Kotick.
The herd never went more than forty or fifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the shore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and under them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went farther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were following up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more. One night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick followed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow was anything of a swimmer.
They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff that ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the foot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they led him through. â€œMy wig!â€ he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at the farther end.
â€œIt was a long dive, but it was worth it.â€ The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all, Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea catch, that no men had ever come there. The first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good, and then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the northward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth of the tunnel.
â€œItâ€™s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,â€ said Kotick. â€œSea Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men canâ€™t come down the cliffs, even if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.â€ He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new country, so that he would be able to answer all questions. Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced through to the southward.
No one but a sea cow or a seal would have dreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them. He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when he hauled out just above Sea Lionâ€™s Neck the first person he met was the seal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes that he had found his island at last. But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young seal about his own age said, â€œThis is all very well, Kotick, but you canâ€™t come from no one knows where and order us off like this.
Remember weâ€™ve been fighting for our nurseries, and thatâ€™s a thing you never did. You preferred prowling about in the sea.â€ The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his head from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a great fuss about it. â€œIâ€™ve no nursery to fight for,â€ said Kotick. â€œI only want to show you all a place where you will be safe.
Whatâ€™s the use of fighting?â€ â€œOh, if youâ€™re trying to back out, of course Iâ€™ve no more to say,â€ said the young seal with an ugly chuckle. â€œWill you come with me if I win?â€ said Kotick. And a green light came into his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all. â€œVery good,â€ said the young seal carelessly.
â€œIf you win, Iâ€™ll come.â€ He had no time to change his mind, for Kotickâ€™s head was out and his teeth sunk in the blubber of the young sealâ€™s neck. Then he threw himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook him, and knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: â€œIâ€™ve done my best for you these five seasons past. Iâ€™ve found you the island where youâ€™ll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks you wonâ€™t believe.
Iâ€™m going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!â€ Limmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin sees ten thousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his little life did he see anything like Kotickâ€™s charge into the nurseries. He flung himself at the biggest sea catch he could find, caught him by the throat, choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for mercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and his deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best of all, he had never fought before.
His curly white mane stood up with rage, and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was splendid to look at.
Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past, hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut, and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave a roar and shouted: â€œHe may be a fool, but he is the best fighter on the beaches! Donâ€™t tackle your father, my son! Heâ€™s with you!â€ Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache on end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was going to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was a gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that dared lift up his head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up and down the beach side by side, bellowing.
At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through the fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. â€œNow,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™ve taught you your lesson.â€ â€œMy wig!â€ said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was fearfully mauled. â€œThe Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up worse. Son, Iâ€™m proud of you, and whatâ€™s more, Iâ€™ll come with you to your island--if there is such a place.â€ â€œHear you, fat pigs of the sea.
Who comes with me to the Sea Cowâ€™s tunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,â€ roared Kotick. There was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the beaches. â€œWe will come,â€ said thousands of tired voices.
â€œWe will follow Kotick, the White Seal.â€ Then Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes proudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail. All the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his wounds.
A week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old seals) went away north to the Sea Cowâ€™s tunnel, Kotick leading them, and the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next spring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotickâ€™s seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cowâ€™s tunnel that more and more seals left Novastoshnah.
Of course it was not all done at once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through, getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the holluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes. Lukannon This is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when they are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of very sad seal National Anthem.
I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!) Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled; I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakersâ€™ songâ€” The Beaches of Lukannonâ€”two million voices strong. _ The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons, The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes, The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flameâ€” The Beaches of Lukannonâ€”before the sealers came! _ I met my mates in the morning (Iâ€™ll never meet them more!); They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore. And oâ€™er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.
_ The Beaches of Lukannonâ€”the winter wheat so tallâ€” The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!
The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn! The Beaches of Lukannonâ€”the home where we were born!_ I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.
Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land; Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame, And still we sing Lukannonâ€”before the sealers came.
_Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!
And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe; Ere, empty as the sharkâ€™s egg the tempest flings ashore, The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!_ â€œRikki-Tikki-Taviâ€      At the hole where he went in      Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin. Hear what little Red-Eye saith:      â€œNag, come up and dance with death!â€      Eye to eye and head to head,     (_Keep the measure, Nag._)      This shall end when one is dead;     (_At thy pleasure, Nag._)      Turn for turn and twist for twistâ€”     (_Run and hide thee, Nag._) Hah!
The hooded Death has missed! (_Woe betide thee, Nag!_) This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee cantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the muskrat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real fighting. He was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but quite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end of his restless nose were pink.
He could scratch himself anywhere he pleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could fluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as he scuttled through the long grass was: â€œRikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!â€ One day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and clung to it till he lost his senses.
When he revived, he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a small boy was saying, â€œHereâ€™s a dead mongoose. Letâ€™s have a funeral.â€ â€œNo,â€ said his mother, â€œletâ€™s take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isnâ€™t really dead.â€ They took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his finger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they wrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he opened his eyes and sneezed.
â€œNow,â€ said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into the bungalow), â€œdonâ€™t frighten him, and weâ€™ll see what heâ€™ll do.â€ It is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because he is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity.
The motto of all the mongoose family is â€œRun and find out,â€ and Rikki-tikki was a true mongoose. He looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched himself, and jumped on the small boyâ€™s shoulder. â€œDonâ€™t be frightened, Teddy,â€ said his father.
â€œThatâ€™s his way of making friends.â€ â€œOuch! Heâ€™s tickling under my chin,â€ said Teddy.
Rikki-tikki looked down between the boyâ€™s collar and neck, snuffed at his ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose. â€œGood gracious,â€ said Teddyâ€™s mother, â€œand thatâ€™s a wild creature! I suppose heâ€™s so tame because weâ€™ve been kind to him.â€ â€œAll mongooses are like that,â€ said her husband.
â€œIf Teddy doesnâ€™t pick him up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, heâ€™ll run in and out of the house all day long. Letâ€™s give him something to eat.â€ They gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it immensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat in the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then he felt better.
â€œThere are more things to find out about in this house,â€ he said to himself, â€œthan all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall certainly stay and find out.â€ He spent all that day roaming over the house.
He nearly drowned himself in the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and burned it on the end of the big manâ€™s cigar, for he climbed up in the big manâ€™s lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into Teddyâ€™s nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion, because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night, and find out what made it.
Teddyâ€™s mother and father came in, the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow.
â€œI donâ€™t like that,â€ said Teddyâ€™s mother. â€œHe may bite the child.â€ â€œHeâ€™ll do no such thing,â€ said the father. â€œTeddyâ€™s safer with that little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake came into the nursery now--â€ But Teddyâ€™s mother wouldnâ€™t think of anything so awful.
Early in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda riding on Teddyâ€™s shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled egg. He sat on all their laps one after the other, because every well-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day and have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikkiâ€™s mother (she used to live in the generalâ€™s house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what to do if ever he came across white men. Then Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen. It was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as summer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of bamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips.
â€œThis is a splendid hunting-ground,â€ he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy at the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing here and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush. It was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful nest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges with fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff.
The nest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried. â€œWhat is the matter?â€ asked Rikki-tikki. â€œWe are very miserable,â€ said Darzee. â€œOne of our babies fell out of the nest yesterday and Nag ate him.â€ â€œHâ€™m!â€ said Rikki-tikki, â€œthat is very sad--but I am a stranger here.
Who is Nag?â€ Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss--a horrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then inch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag, the big black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail. When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snakeâ€™s eyes that never change their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of. â€œWho is Nag?â€ said he.
â€œI am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon all our people, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off Brahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!â€ He spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the spectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part of a hook-and-eye fastening.
He was afraid for the minute, but it is impossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and though Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother had fed him on dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongooseâ€™s business in life was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom of his cold heart, he was afraid. â€œWell,â€ said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, â€œmarks or no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a nest?â€ Nag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in the grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden meant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get Rikki-tikki off his guard.
So he dropped his head a little, and put it on one side. â€œLet us talk,â€ he said. â€œYou eat eggs.
Why should not I eat birds?â€ â€œBehind you! Look behind you!â€ sang Darzee. Rikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up in the air as high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the head of Nagaina, Nagâ€™s wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he was talking, to make an end of him.
He heard her savage hiss as the stroke missed. He came down almost across her back, and if he had been an old mongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back with one bite; but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke of the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite long enough, and he jumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and angry.
â€œWicked, wicked Darzee!â€ said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach toward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach of snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.
Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongooseâ€™s eyes grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.
When a snake misses its stroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do next. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure that he could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel path near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for him.
If you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say that when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten, he runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true. The victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of foot--snakeâ€™s blow against mongooseâ€™s jump--and as no eye can follow the motion of a snakeâ€™s head when it strikes, this makes things much more wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose, and it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to escape a blow from behind.
It gave him confidence in himself, and when Teddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted. But just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust, and a tiny voice said: â€œBe careful.
I am Death!â€ It was Karait, the dusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his bite is as dangerous as the cobraâ€™s. But he is so small that nobody thinks of him, and so he does the more harm to people.
Rikki-tikkiâ€™s eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the peculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family. It looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can fly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this is an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more dangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn so quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to the back of the head, he would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not know.
His eyes were all red, and he rocked back and forth, looking for a good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and tried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a fraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head followed his heels close. Teddy shouted to the house: â€œOh, look here!
Our mongoose is killing a snake.â€ And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddyâ€™s mother. His father ran out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out once too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snakeâ€™s back, dropped his head far between his forelegs, bitten as high up the back as he could get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and Rikki-tikki was just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom of his family at dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a slow mongoose, and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he must keep himself thin. He went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while Teddyâ€™s father beat the dead Karait.
â€œWhat is the use of that?â€ thought Rikki-tikki. â€œI have settled it all;â€ and then Teddyâ€™s mother picked him up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved Teddy from death, and Teddyâ€™s father said that he was a providence, and Teddy looked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the fuss, which, of course, he did not understand. Teddyâ€™s mother might just as well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust.
Rikki was thoroughly enjoying himself. That night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the table, he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things. But he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be patted and petted by Teddyâ€™s mother, and to sit on Teddyâ€™s shoulder, his eyes would get red from time to time, and he would go off into his long war cry of â€œRikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!â€ Teddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under his chin.
Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon as Teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house, and in the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the muskrat, creeping around by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He whimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up his mind to run into the middle of the room.
But he never gets there.
â€œDonâ€™t kill me,â€ said Chuchundra, almost weeping. â€œRikki-tikki, donâ€™t kill me!â€ â€œDo you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?â€ said Rikki-tikki scornfully. â€œThose who kill snakes get killed by snakes,â€ said Chuchundra, more sorrowfully than ever.
â€œAnd how am I to be sure that Nag wonâ€™t mistake me for you some dark night?â€ â€œThereâ€™s not the least danger,â€ said Rikki-tikki. â€œBut Nag is in the garden, and I know you donâ€™t go there.â€ â€œMy cousin Chua, the rat, told me--â€ said Chuchundra, and then he stopped. â€œTold you what?â€ â€œHâ€™sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in the garden.â€ â€œI didnâ€™t--so you must tell me.
Quick, Chuchundra, or Iâ€™ll bite you!â€ Chuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers. â€œI am a very poor man,â€ he sobbed. â€œI never had spirit enough to run out into the middle of the room.
Hâ€™sh!
I mustnâ€™t tell you anything. Canâ€™t you hear, Rikki-tikki?â€ Rikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he could just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as faint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a snakeâ€™s scales on brick-work.
â€œThatâ€™s Nag or Nagaina,â€ he said to himself, â€œand he is crawling into the bath-room sluice. Youâ€™re right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to Chua.â€ He stole off to Teddyâ€™s bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then to Teddyâ€™s motherâ€™s bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall there was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as Rikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he heard Nag and Nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight. â€œWhen the house is emptied of people,â€ said Nagaina to her husband, â€œhe will have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again.
Go in quietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first one to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki together.â€ â€œBut are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the people?â€ said Nag.
â€œEverything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any mongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king and queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the melon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and quiet.â€ â€œI had not thought of that,â€ said Nag. â€œI will go, but there is no need that we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward.
I will kill the big man and his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the bungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.â€ Rikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then Nagâ€™s head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body followed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw the size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head, and looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his eyes glitter.
â€œNow, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on the open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?â€ said Rikki-tikki-tavi. Nag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the biggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. â€œThat is good,â€ said the snake.
â€œNow, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may have that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he will not have a stick. I shall wait here till he comes.
Nagaina--do you hear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till daytime.â€ There was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone away. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the bottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death.
After an hour he began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep, and Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which would be the best place for a good hold. â€œIf I donâ€™t break his back at the first jump,â€ said Rikki, â€œhe can still fight. And if he fights--O Rikki!â€ He looked at the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too much for him; and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.
â€œIt must be the headâ€â€™ he said at last; â€œthe head above the hood. And, when I am once there, I must not let go.â€ Then he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar, under the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back against the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head.
This gave him just one secondâ€™s purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the floor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his eyes were red and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the tin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and banged against the tin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter, for he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his family, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked.
He was dizzy, aching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a thunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had fired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood. Rikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was dead.
But the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said, â€œItâ€™s the mongoose again, Alice.
The little chap has saved our lives now.â€ Then Teddyâ€™s mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was left of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddyâ€™s bedroom and spent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out whether he really was broken into forty pieces, as he fancied. When morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings. â€œNow I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five Nags, and thereâ€™s no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch.
Goodness!
I must go and see Darzee,â€ he said. Without waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where Darzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice. The news of Nagâ€™s death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the body on the rubbish-heap.
â€œOh, you stupid tuft of feathers!â€ said Rikki-tikki angrily.
â€œIs this the time to sing?â€ â€œNag is dead--is dead--is dead!â€ sang Darzee. â€œThe valiant Rikki-tikki caught him by the head and held fast. The big man brought the bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my babies again.â€ â€œAll thatâ€™s true enough.
But whereâ€™s Nagaina?â€ said Rikki-tikki, looking carefully round him.
â€œNagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,â€ Darzee went on, â€œand Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him up on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap.
Let us sing about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!â€ And Darzee filled his throat and sang. â€œIf I could get up to your nest, Iâ€™d roll your babies out!â€ said Rikki-tikki. â€œYou donâ€™t know when to do the right thing at the right time. Youâ€™re safe enough in your nest there, but itâ€™s war for me down here. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.â€ â€œFor the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikkiâ€™s sake I will stop,â€ said Darzee.
â€œWhat is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?â€ â€œWhere is Nagaina, for the third time?â€ â€œOn the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.â€ â€œBother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?â€ â€œIn the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes nearly all day.
She hid them there weeks ago.â€ â€œAnd you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the wall, you said?â€ â€œRikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?â€ â€œNot eat exactly; no.
Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina chase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went there now sheâ€™d see me.â€ Darzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more than one idea at a time in his head. And just because he knew that Nagainaâ€™s children were born in eggs like his own, he didnâ€™t think at first that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible bird, and she knew that cobraâ€™s eggs meant young cobras later on.
So she flew off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some ways. She fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out, â€œOh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and broke it.â€ Then she fluttered more desperately than ever. Nagaina lifted up her head and hissed, â€œYou warned Rikki-tikki when I would have killed him.
Indeed and truly, youâ€™ve chosen a bad place to be lame in.â€ And she moved toward Darzeeâ€™s wife, slipping along over the dust. â€œThe boy broke it with a stone!â€ shrieked Darzeeâ€™s wife. â€œWell!
It may be some consolation to you when youâ€™re dead to know that I shall settle accounts with the boy.
My husband lies on the rubbish heap this morning, but before night the boy in the house will lie very still. What is the use of running away? I am sure to catch you.
Little fool, look at me!â€ Darzeeâ€™s wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a snakeâ€™s eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzeeâ€™s wife fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and Nagaina quickened her pace. Rikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced for the end of the melon patch near the wall.
There, in the warm litter above the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs, about the size of a bantamâ€™s eggs, but with whitish skin instead of shell. â€œI was not a day too soon,â€ he said, for he could see the baby cobras curled up inside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were hatched they could each kill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops of the eggs as fast as he could, taking care to crush the young cobras, and turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed any. At last there were only three eggs left, and Rikki-tikki began to chuckle to himself, when he heard Darzeeâ€™s wife screaming: â€œRikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the veranda, and-- oh, come quickly--she means killing!â€ Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed with the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as he could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white.
Nagaina was coiled up on the matting by Teddyâ€™s chair, within easy striking distance of Teddyâ€™s bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of triumph. â€œSon of the big man that killed Nag,â€ she hissed, â€œstay still. I am not ready yet. Wait a little.
Keep very still, all you three! If you move I strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed my Nag!â€ Teddyâ€™s eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was to whisper, â€œSit still, Teddy. You mustnâ€™t move.
Teddy, keep still.â€ Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, â€œTurn round, Nagaina. Turn and fight!â€ â€œAll in good time,â€ said she, without moving her eyes. â€œI will settle my account with you presently.
Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a step nearer I strike.â€ â€œLook at your eggs,â€ said Rikki-tikki, â€œin the melon bed near the wall.
Go and look, Nagaina!â€ The big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda.
â€œAh-h!
Give it to me,â€ she said. Rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were blood-red. â€œWhat price for a snakeâ€™s egg?
For a young cobra?
For a young king cobra?
For the last--the very last of the brood?
The ants are eating all the others down by the melon bed.â€ Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddyâ€™s father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy by the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups, safe and out of reach of Nagaina. â€œTricked!
Tricked! Tricked!
Rikk-tck-tck!â€ chuckled Rikki-tikki. â€œThe boy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last night in the bathroom.â€ Then he began to jump up and down, all four feet together, his head close to the floor. â€œHe threw me to and fro, but he could not shake me off.
He was dead before the big man blew him in two. I did it!
Rikki-tikki-tck-tck!
Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with me.
You shall not be a widow long.â€ Nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg lay between Rikki-tikkiâ€™s paws. â€œGive me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me the last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,â€ she said, lowering her hood. â€œYes, you will go away, and you will never come back.
For you will go to the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his gun!
Fight!â€ Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach of her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself together and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward.
Again and again and again she struck, and each time her head came with a whack on the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her, and Nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head, so that the rustle of her tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind. He had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing breath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her.
When the cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a horseâ€™s neck. Rikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin again. She headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as he was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little song of triumph. But Darzeeâ€™s wife was wiser.
She flew off her nest as Nagaina came along, and flapped her wings about Nagainaâ€™s head. If Darzee had helped they might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered her hood and went on. Still, the instantâ€™s delay brought Rikki-tikki up to her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to live, his little white teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down with her--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be, care to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and Rikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to turn and strike at him.
He held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth. Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said, â€œIt is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant Rikki-tikki is dead!
For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.â€ So he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the minute, and just as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered again, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the hole leg by leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little shout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed. â€œIt is all over,â€ he said.
â€œThe widow will never come out again.â€ And the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him, and began to troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth. Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was--slept and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard dayâ€™s work. â€œNow,â€ he said, when he awoke, â€œI will go back to the house. Tell the Coppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.â€ The Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of a little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always making it is because he is the town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all the news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the path, he heard his â€œattentionâ€ notes like a tiny dinner gong, and then the steady â€œDing-dong-tock!
Nag is dead--dong! Nagaina is dead!
Ding-dong-tock!â€ That set all the birds in the garden singing, and the frogs croaking, for Nag and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little birds. When Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddyâ€™s mother (she looked very white still, for she had been fainting) and Teddyâ€™s father came out and almost cried over him; and that night he ate all that was given him till he could eat no more, and went to bed on Teddyâ€™s shoulder, where Teddyâ€™s mother saw him when she came to look late at night.
â€œHe saved our lives and Teddyâ€™s life,â€ she said to her husband. â€œJust think, he saved all our lives.â€ Rikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.
â€œOh, itâ€™s you,â€ said he. â€œWhat are you bothering for? All the cobras are dead. And if they werenâ€™t, Iâ€™m here.â€ Rikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself.
But he did not grow too proud, and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth and jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head inside the walls.
Darzeeâ€™s Chant      (Sung in honor of Rikki-tikki-tavi)      Singer and tailor am I--         Doubled the joys that I know--      Proud of my lilt to the sky,         Proud of the house that I sew-- Over and under, so weave I my music--so weave I the house that I         sew. Sing to your fledglings again, Mother, oh lift up your head!
Evil that plagued us is slain,         Death in the garden lies dead.
Terror that hid in the roses is impotent--flung on the dung-hill      and dead!
Who has delivered us, who?
Tell me his nest and his name. Rikki, the valiant, the true,         Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,      Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of      flame!
Give him the Thanks of the Birds,         Bowing with tail feathers spread! Praise him with nightingale words--         Nay, I will praise him instead. Hear! I will sing you the praise of the bottle-tailed Rikki, with      eyeballs of red!
(_Here Rikki-tikki interrupted, and the rest of the song is lost._) Toomai of the Elephants      I will remember what I was, I am sick of rope and chain--         I will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs. I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane:         I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs. I will go out until the day, until the morning break--         Out to the windâ€™s untainted kiss, the waterâ€™s clean caress;      I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket stake. I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!
Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in every way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years, and as he was fully twenty years old when he was caught, that makes him nearly seventy--a ripe age for an elephant.
He remembered pushing, with a big leather pad on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was before the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full strength. His mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had been caught in the same drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had dropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag knew that that advice was good, for the first time that he saw a shell burst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the bayonets pricked him in all his softest places.
So, before he was twenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved and the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of India. He had carried tents, twelve hundred poundsâ€ ™ weight of tents, on the march in Upper India.
He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of a steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a mortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India, and had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had come back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the Abyssinian War medal. He had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and epilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid, ten years later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles south to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein. There he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was shirking his fair share of work. After that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few score other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to catch wild elephants among the Garo hills.
Elephants are very strictly preserved by the Indian Government. There is one whole department which does nothing else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and send them up and down the country as they are needed for work. Kala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been cut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them splitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps than any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When, after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across the hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last stockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together, jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go into that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when the flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances), and, picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer him and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other elephants roped and tied the smaller ones.
There was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise Black Snake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his time to the charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk to be out of harmâ€™s way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in mid-air with a quick sickle cut of his head, that he had invented all by himself; had knocked him over, and kneeled upon him with his huge knees till the life went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a fluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail. â€œYes,â€ said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had taken him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had seen him caught, â€œthere is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me. He has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him, and he will live to see four.â€ â€œHe is afraid of me also,â€ said Little Toomai, standing up to his full height of four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old, the eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take his fatherâ€™s place on Kala Nagâ€™s neck when he grew up, and would handle the heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by his father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather. He knew what he was talking of; for he had been born under Kala Nagâ€™s shadow, had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk, had taken him down to water as soon as he could walk, and Kala Nag would no more have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would have dreamed of killing him on that day when Big Toomai carried the little brown baby under Kala Nagâ€™s tusks, and told him to salute his master that was to be.
â€œYes,â€ said Little Toomai, â€œhe is afraid of me,â€ and he took long strides up to Kala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up his feet one after the other.
â€œWah!â€ said Little Toomai, â€œthou art a big elephant,â€ and he wagged his fluffy head, quoting his father. â€œThe Government may pay for elephants, but they belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will come some rich rajah, and he will buy thee from the Government, on account of thy size and thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing to do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a gold howdah on thy back, and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides, and walk at the head of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit on thy neck, O Kala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us with golden sticks, crying, `Room for the Kingâ€™s elephant!â€™ That will be good, Kala Nag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles.â€ â€œUmph!â€ said Big Toomai. â€œThou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf.
This running up and down among the hills is not the best Government service. I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me brick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie them to safely, and flat, broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this come-and-go camping. Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good.
There was a bazaar close by, and only three hoursâ€™ work a day.â€ Little Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing. He very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads, with the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long hours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in his pickets. What Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an elephant could take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the wild elephants browsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and peacock under Kala Nagâ€™s feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the hills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew where they would camp that night; the steady, cautious drive of the wild elephants, and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last nightâ€™s drive, when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a landslide, found that they could not get out, and flung themselves at the heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and volleys of blank cartridge.
Even a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as three boys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the best. But the really good time came when the driving out began, and the Keddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of the end of the world, and men had to make signs to one another, because they could not hear themselves speak.
Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top of one of the quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown hair flying loose all over his shoulders, and he looking like a goblin in the torch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could hear his high-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting and crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered elephants. â€œMael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do!
(Give him the tusk!) Somalo!
Somalo!
(Careful, careful!) Maro!
Mar!
(Hit him, hit him!) Mind the post! Arre!
Arre!
Hai! Yai!
Kya-a-ah!â€ he would shout, and the big fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would sway to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant catchers would wipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find time to nod to Little Toomai wriggling with joy on the top of the posts. He did more than wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and slipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope, which had dropped, to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on the leg of a kicking young calf (calves always give more trouble than full-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught him in his trunk, and handed him up to Big Toomai, who slapped him then and there, and put him back on the post. Next morning he gave him a scolding and said, â€œAre not good brick elephant lines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs go elephant catching on thy own account, little worthless?
Now those foolish hunters, whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen Sahib of the matter.â€ Little Toomai was frightened. He did not know much of white men, but Petersen Sahib was the greatest white man in the world to him. He was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man who caught all the elephants for the Government of India, and who knew more about the ways of elephants than any living man. â€œWhat--what will happen?â€ said Little Toomai.
â€œHappen! The worst that can happen.
Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why should he go hunting these wild devils? He may even require thee to be an elephant catcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles, and at last to be trampled to death in the Keddah.
It is well that this nonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is over, and we of the plains are sent back to our stations. Then we will march on smooth roads, and forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that thou shouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty Assamese jungle folk.
Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with him into the Keddah, but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does not help to rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere hunter,--a mahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of his service. Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden underfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? Bad one!
Wicked one! Worthless son!
Go and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see that there are no thorns in his feet.
Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and make thee a wild hunter--a follower of elephantâ€™s foot tracks, a jungle bear. Bah!
Shame!
Go!â€ Little Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all his grievances while he was examining his feet. â€œNo matter,â€ said Little Toomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nagâ€™s huge right ear. â€œThey have said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and perhaps--and perhaps--who knows?
Hai!
That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!â€ The next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in walking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of tame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march to the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things that had been worn out or lost in the forest.
Petersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been paying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an end, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to pay the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he went back to his elephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers, and hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in the jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that belonged to Petersen Sahibâ€™s permanent force, or leaned against the trees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who were going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the line and ran about. Big Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and Machua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his, â€œThere goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least.
â€™Tis a pity to send that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.â€ Now Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens to the most silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He turned where he was lying all along on Pudminiâ€™s back and said, â€œWhat is that? I did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to rope even a dead elephant.â€ â€œThis is not a man, but a boy.
He went into the Keddah at the last drive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that young calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.â€ Machua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and Little Toomai bowed to the earth. â€œHe throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is thy name?â€ said Petersen Sahib.
Little Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him, and Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in his trunk and held him level with Pudminiâ€™s forehead, in front of the great Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his hands, for he was only a child, and except where elephants were concerned, he was just as bashful as a child could be.
â€œOho!â€ said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, â€œand why didst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal green corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to dry?â€ â€œNot green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons,â€ said Little Toomai, and all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of them had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys.
Little Toomai was hanging eight feet up in the air, and he wished very much that he were eight feet underground. â€œHe is Toomai, my son, Sahib,â€ said Big Toomai, scowling. â€œHe is a very bad boy, and he will end in a jail, Sahib.â€ â€œOf that I have my doubts,â€ said Petersen Sahib. â€œA boy who can face a full Keddah at his age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are four annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under that great thatch of hair.
In time thou mayest become a hunter too.â€ Big Toomai scowled more than ever. â€œRemember, though, that Keddahs are not good for children to play in,â€ Petersen Sahib went on. â€œMust I never go there, Sahib?â€ asked Little Toomai with a big gasp. â€œYes.â€ Petersen Sahib smiled again.
â€œWhen thou hast seen the elephants dance. That is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the elephants dance, and then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs.â€ There was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among elephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat places hidden away in the forests that are called elephantsâ€™ ball-rooms, but even these are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the elephants dance. When a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other drivers say, â€œAnd when didst thou see the elephants dance?â€ Kala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again and went away with his father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his mother, who was nursing his baby brother, and they all were put up on Kala Nagâ€™s back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled down the hill path to the plains.
It was a very lively march on account of the new elephants, who gave trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing or beating every other minute. Big Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but Little Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him, and given him money, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he had been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief. â€œWhat did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?â€ he said, at last, softly to his mother. Big Toomai heard him and grunted.
â€œThat thou shouldst never be one of these hill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he meant. Oh, you in front, what is blocking the way?â€ An Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily, crying: â€œBring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good behavior. Why should Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you donkeys of the rice fields?
Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and let him prod with his tusks. By all the Gods of the Hills, these new elephants are possessed, or else they can smell their companions in the jungle.â€ Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the wind out of him, as Big Toomai said, â€œWe have swept the hills of wild elephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving. Must I keep order along the whole line?â€ â€œHear him!â€ said the other driver.
â€œWe have swept the hills! Ho!
Ho!
You are very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw the jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the season. Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I waste wisdom on a river-turtle?â€ â€œWhat will they do?â€ Little Toomai called out.
â€œOhe, little one.
Art thou there?
Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast a cool head. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has swept all the hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets to-night.â€ â€œWhat talk is this?â€ said Big Toomai. â€œFor forty years, father and son, we have tended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about dances.â€ â€œYes; but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls of his hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what comes.
As for their dancing, I have seen the place where--Bapree-bap!
How many windings has the Dihang River? Here is another ford, and we must swim the calves. Stop still, you behind there.â€ And in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers, they made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new elephants. But they lost their tempers long before they got there.
Then the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps of pickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the fodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen Sahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be extra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the reason. Little Toomai attended to Kala Nagâ€™s supper, and as evening fell, wandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom. When an Indian childâ€™s heart is full, he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular fashion.
He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he had not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill.
But the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten with the flat of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he thumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone among the elephant fodder.
There was no tune and no words, but the thumping made him happy. The new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted from time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting his small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God Shiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very soothing lullaby, and the first verse says:      Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,      Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,      Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,      From the King upon the _guddee_ to the Beggar at the gate.
All things made he--Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo!
Mahadeo!
He made all--      Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,      And motherâ€™s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine! Little Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each verse, till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala Nagâ€™s side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another as is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was left standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put forward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the hills. The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together, make one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the other, the rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk of a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than we imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away.
Little Toomai slept for some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala Nag was still standing up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned, rustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against half the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away that it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the stillness, the â€œhoot-tootâ€ of a wild elephant. All the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and their grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and drove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and knotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up his picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nagâ€™s leg chain and shackled that elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string round Kala Nagâ€™s leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast.
He knew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same thing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order by gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking out across the moonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to the great folds of the Garo hills. â€œTend to him if he grows restless in the night,â€ said Big Toomai to Little Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was just going to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a little â€œtang,â€ and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as silently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley.
Little Toomai pattered after him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling under his breath, â€œKala Nag! Kala Nag!
Take me with you, O Kala Nag!â€  The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the boy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck, and almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the forest. There was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the silence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes a tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the sides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would scrape along his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder touched it.
But between those times he moved absolutely without any sound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been smoke.
He was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars in the rifts of the trees, he could not tell in what direction. Then Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute, and Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and furry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist over the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he felt that the forest was awake below him--awake and alive and crowded. A big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupineâ€™s quills rattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems he heard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as it digged. Then the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go down into the valley--not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes down a steep bank--in one rush.
The huge limbs moved as steadily as pistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow points rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a noise like torn canvas, and the saplings that he heaved away right and left with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank, and great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his tusks as he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway. Then Little Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging bough should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back in the lines again. The grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nagâ€™s feet sucked and squelched as he put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley chilled Little Toomai.
There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of running water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling his way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round the elephantâ€™s legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some trumpeting both upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and all the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows. â€œAi!â€ he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. â€œThe elephant-folk are out tonight.
It is the dance, then!â€ Kala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began another climb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make his path.
That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where the bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many elephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little Toomai looked back, and behind him a great wild tusker with his little pigâ€™s eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the misty river. Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up, with trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on every side of them.
At last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top of the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an irregular space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as Little Toomai could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as a brick floor. Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their bark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and polished in the patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from the upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great waxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But within the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of green--nothing but the trampled earth.
The moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants stood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked, holding his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he looked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from between the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and he counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the tens, and his head began to swim. Outside the clearing he could hear them crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the hillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks they moved like ghosts.
There were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and twigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears; fat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black calves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young elephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of them; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious faces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred from shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights, and the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their shoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the full-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tigerâ€™s claws on his side. They were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground in couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores of elephants. Toomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nagâ€™s neck nothing would happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive a wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame elephant.
And these elephants were not thinking of men that night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen Sahibâ€™s pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling up the hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from Petersen Sahibâ€™s camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that he did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too, must have run away from some camp in the hills about. At last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest, and Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into the middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants began to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.
Still lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of broad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling eyes. He heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by accident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing of enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick and hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud came over the moon, and he sat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and gurgling went on just the same.
He knew that there were elephants all round Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him out of the assembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least there was torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and once a trunk came up and touched him on the knee. Then an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds.
The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at first, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and grew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and brought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as trip-hammers.
The elephants were stamping all together now, and it sounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on, and the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth.
Once or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward a few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of juicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom of feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning somewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag moved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the clearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two or three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a shuffle, and the booming went on.
It must have lasted fully two hours, and Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the night air that the dawn was coming. The morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills, and the booming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had been an order. Before Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head, before even he had shifted his position, there was not an elephant in sight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls, and there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to show where the others had gone. Little Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he remembered it, had grown in the night.
More trees stood in the middle of it, but the undergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back. Little Toomai stared once more. Now he understood the trampling. The elephants had stamped out more room--had stamped the thick grass and juicy cane to trash, the trash into slivers, the slivers into tiny fibers, and the fibers into hard earth.
â€œWah!â€ said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy.
â€œKala Nag, my lord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahibâ€™s camp, or I shall drop from thy neck.â€ The third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and took his own path. He may have belonged to some little native kingâ€™s establishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away. Two hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his elephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and Pudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled into the camp. Little Toomaiâ€™s face was gray and pinched, and his hair was full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute Petersen Sahib, and cried faintly: â€œThe dance--the elephant dance!
I have seen it, and--I die!â€ As Kala Nag sat down, he slid off his neck in a dead faint. But, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two hours he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahibâ€™s hammock with Petersen Sahibâ€™s shooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk, a little brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him, and while the old hairy, scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him, looking at him as though he were a spirit, he told his tale in short words, as a child will, and wound up with: â€œNow, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the elephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and they will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that dance-room.
They made more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala Nag took me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!â€ Little Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into the twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed the track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills.
Petersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he had only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need to look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to scratch with his toe in the packed, rammed earth. â€œThe child speaks truth,â€ said he. â€œAll this was done last night, and I have counted seventy tracks crossing the river.
See, Sahib, where Pudminiâ€™s leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.â€ They looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the ways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to fathom.
â€œForty years and five,â€ said Machua Appa, â€œhave I followed my lord, the elephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what this child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we say?â€ and he shook his head. When they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal.
Petersen Sahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should have two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and rice and salt, for he knew that there would be a feast. Big Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for his son and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at them as though he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by the blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants, and Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant catchers, the trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all the secrets of breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to the other, and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a newly killed jungle-cock, to show that he was a forester, initiated and free of all the jungles. And at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs made the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too, Machua Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua Appa, Petersen Sahibâ€™s other self, who had never seen a made road in forty years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he had no other name than Machua Appa,--leaped to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in the air above his head, and shouted: â€œListen, my brothers.
Listen, too, you my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This little one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the Elephants, as his great-grandfather was called before him. What never man has seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the elephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him.
He shall become a great tracker. He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua Appa! He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed trail, with a clear eye! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he runs under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he slips before the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant shall know who he is and shall not crush him.
Aihai!
my lords in the chains,â€--he whirled up the line of pickets--â€œhere is the little one that has seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never man saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children.
Make your salute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa!
Hira Guj, Birchi Guj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa!
Pudmini,--thou hast seen him at the dance, and thou too, Kala Nag, my pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together!
To Toomai of the Elephants. Barrao!â€ And at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the tips touched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the crashing trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut of the Keddah. But it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never man had seen before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the Garo hills!
Shiv and the Grasshopper      (The song that Toomaiâ€™s mother sang to the baby)      Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,      Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,      Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,      From the King upon the _guddee_ to the Beggar at the gate. _ All things made he--Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo!
Mahadeo!
He made all,--         Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,         And motherâ€™s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!_ Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor,      Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door;      Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,      And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night. Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low--      Parbati beside him watched them come and go;      Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest--      Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.
_ So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo!
Mahadeo!
Turn and see.
Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine, But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine! _ When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,      â€œMaster, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?â€       Laughing, Shiv made answer, â€œAll have had their part,      Even he, the little one, hidden â€™neath thy heart.â€       From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief,      Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf! Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv,      Who hath surely given meat to all that live. _ All things made he--Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo!
Mahadeo!
He made all,--         Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,         And motherâ€™s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!_ Her Majestyâ€™s Servants      You can work it out by Fractions or by simple Rule of Three,      But the way of Tweedle-dum is not the way of Tweedle-dee.
You can twist it, you can turn it, you can plait it till you drop,      But the way of Pilly Winkyâ€™s not the way of Winkie Pop! It had been raining heavily for one whole month--raining on a camp of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses, bullocks, and mules all gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi, to be reviewed by the Viceroy of India.
He was receiving a visit from the Amir of Afghanistan--a wild king of a very wild country. The Amir had brought with him for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who had never seen a camp or a locomotive before in their lives--savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or the camels would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents, and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep.
My tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe. But one night a man popped his head in and shouted, â€œGet out, quick!
Theyâ€™re coming!
My tentâ€™s gone!â€ I knew who â€œtheyâ€ were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out into the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the other side; and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling, and I saw the tent cave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance about like a mad ghost. A camel had blundered into it, and wet and angry as I was, I could not help laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not know how many camels might have got loose, and before long I was out of sight of the camp, plowing my way through the mud. At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at night.
As I did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and the dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that I found, and lay along the tail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I might be. Just as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and things on his saddle pad.
The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country. Behind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching and slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed henâ€™s. Luckily, I knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast language, but camp-beast language, of course--from the natives to know what he was saying.
He must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to the mule, â€œWhat shall I do?
Where shall I go? I have fought with a white thing that waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.â€ (That was my broken tent pole, and I was very glad to know it.) â€œShall we run on?â€ â€œOh, it was you,â€ said the mule, â€œyou and your friends, that have been disturbing the camp?
All right.
Youâ€™ll be beaten for this in the morning. But I may as well give you something on account now.â€ I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel two kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum.
â€œAnother time,â€ he said, â€œyouâ€™ll know better than to run through a mule battery at night, shouting `Thieves and fire!â€™ Sit down, and keep your silly neck quiet.â€ The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down whimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped a gun tail, and landed close to the mule. â€œItâ€™s disgraceful,â€ he said, blowing out his nostrils. â€œThose camels have racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. Howâ€™s a horse to keep his condition if he isnâ€™t allowed to sleep.
Whoâ€™s here?â€ â€œIâ€™m the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw Battery,â€ said the mule, â€œand the otherâ€™s one of your friends. Heâ€™s waked me up too. Who are you?â€ â€œNumber Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffeâ€™s horse. Stand over a little, there.â€ â€œOh, beg your pardon,â€ said the mule. â€œItâ€™s too dark to see much.
Arenâ€™t these camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get a little peace and quiet here.â€ â€œMy lords,â€ said the camel humbly, â€œwe dreamed bad dreams in the night, and we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.â€ â€œThen why didnâ€™t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?â€ said the mule.
â€œThey were such very bad dreams,â€ said the camel. â€œI am sorry. Listen! What is that?
Shall we run on again?â€ â€œSit down,â€ said the mule, â€œor youâ€™ll snap your long stick-legs between the guns.â€ He cocked one ear and listened. â€œBullocks!â€ he said. â€œGun bullocks.
On my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very thoroughly. It takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.â€ I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants wonâ€™t go any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost stepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for â€œBilly.â€ â€œThatâ€™s one of our recruits,â€ said the old mule to the troop horse.
â€œHeâ€™s calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing.
The dark never hurt anybody yet.â€ The gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the young mule huddled close to Billy.
â€œThings!â€ he said. â€œFearful and horrible, Billy!
They came into our lines while we were asleep. Dâ€™you think theyâ€™ll kill us?â€ â€œIâ€™ve a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,â€ said Billy. â€œThe idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the battery before this gentleman!â€ â€œGently, gently!â€ said the troop-horse. â€œRemember they are always like this to begin with.
The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia when I was a three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if Iâ€™d seen a camel, I should have been running still.â€ Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from Australia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves. â€œTrue enough,â€ said Billy. â€œStop shaking, youngster.
The first time they put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on my forelegs and kicked every bit of it off. I hadnâ€™t learned the real science of kicking then, but the battery said they had never seen anything like it.â€ â€œBut this wasnâ€™t harness or anything that jingled,â€ said the young mule. â€œYou know I donâ€™t mind that now, Billy.
It was Things like trees, and they fell up and down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and I couldnâ€™t find my driver, and I couldnâ€™t find you, Billy, so I ran off with--with these gentlemen.â€ â€œHâ€™m!â€ said Billy. â€œAs soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away on my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks gentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the ground there?â€ The gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: â€œThe seventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery.
We were asleep when the camels came, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked away. It is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good bedding. We told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid of, but he knew so much that he thought otherwise.
Wah!â€ They went on chewing. â€œThat comes of being afraid,â€ said Billy. â€œYou get laughed at by gun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young un.â€ The young muleâ€™s teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not being afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks only clicked their horns together and went on chewing.
â€œNow, donâ€™t be angry after youâ€™ve been afraid. Thatâ€™s the worst kind of cowardice,â€ said the troop-horse. â€œAnybody can be forgiven for being scared in the night, I think, if they see things they donâ€™t understand. Weâ€™ve broken out of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in Australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our head-ropes.â€ â€œThatâ€™s all very well in camp,â€ said Billy. â€œIâ€™m not above stampeding myself, for the fun of the thing, when I havenâ€™t been out for a day or two.
But what do you do on active service?â€ â€œOh, thatâ€™s quite another set of new shoes,â€ said the troop horse.
â€œDick Cunliffeâ€™s on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have to do is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs well under me, and be bridle-wise.â€ â€œWhatâ€™s bridle-wise?â€ said the young mule. â€œBy the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,â€ snorted the troop-horse, â€œdo you mean to say that you arenâ€™t taught to be bridle-wise in your business? How can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your neck? It means life or death to your man, and of course thatâ€™s life and death to you.
Get round with your hind legs under you the instant you feel the rein on your neck. If you havenâ€™t room to swing round, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs. Thatâ€™s being bridle-wise.â€ â€œWe arenâ€™t taught that way,â€ said Billy the mule stiffly. â€œWeâ€™re taught to obey the man at our head: step off when he says so, and step in when he says so. I suppose it comes to the same thing.
Now, with all this fine fancy business and rearing, which must be very bad for your hocks, what do you do?â€ â€œThat depends,â€ said the troop-horse. â€œGenerally I have to go in among a lot of yelling, hairy men with knives--long shiny knives, worse than the farrierâ€™s knives--and I have to take care that Dickâ€™s boot is just touching the next manâ€™s boot without crushing it. I can see Dickâ€™s lance to the right of my right eye, and I know Iâ€™m safe. I shouldnâ€™t care to be the man or horse that stood up to Dick and me when weâ€™re in a hurry.â€ â€œDonâ€™t the knives hurt?â€ said the young mule. â€œWell, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasnâ€™t Dickâ€™s fault--â€ â€œA lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!â€ said the young mule.
â€œYou must,â€ said the troop horse. â€œIf you donâ€™t trust your man, you may as well run away at once. Thatâ€™s what some of our horses do, and I donâ€™t blame them.
As I was saying, it wasnâ€™t Dickâ€™s fault. The man was lying on the ground, and I stretched myself not to tread on him, and he slashed up at me. Next time I have to go over a man lying down I shall step on him--hard.â€ â€œHâ€™m!â€ said Billy.
â€œIt sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things at any time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a well-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and creep and crawl and wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a ledge where thereâ€™s just room enough for your hoofs. Then you stand still and keep quiet--never ask a man to hold your head, young un--keep quiet while the guns are being put together, and then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the tree-tops ever so far below.â€ â€œDonâ€™t you ever trip?â€ said the troop-horse. â€œThey say that when a mule trips you can split a henâ€™s ear,â€ said Billy.
â€œNow and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but itâ€™s very seldom. I wish I could show you our business. Itâ€™s beautiful. Why, it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at.
The science of the thing is never to show up against the sky line, because, if you do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep hidden as much as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your way. I lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing.â€ â€œFired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!â€  said the troop-horse, thinking hard.
â€œI couldnâ€™t stand that. I should want to charge--with Dick.â€ â€œOh, no, you wouldnâ€™t. You know that as soon as the guns are in position theyâ€™ll do all the charging. Thatâ€™s scientific and neat.
But knives--pah!â€ The baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time past, anxious to get a word in edgewise.
Then I heard him say, as he cleared his throat, nervously: â€œI--I--I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that running way.â€ â€œNo. Now you mention it,â€ said Billy, â€œyou donâ€™t look as though you were made for climbing or running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?â€ â€œThe proper way,â€ said the camel.
â€œWe all sat down--â€ â€œOh, my crupper and breastplate!â€ said the troop-horse under his breath. â€œSat down!â€ â€œWe sat down--a hundred of us,â€ the camel went on, â€œin a big square, and the men piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired over our backs, the men did, on all sides of the square.â€ â€œWhat sort of men? Any men that came along?â€ said the troop-horse.
â€œThey teach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across us, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man Iâ€™d trust to do that.
It tickles my girths, and, besides, I canâ€™t see with my head on the ground.â€ â€œWhat does it matter who fires across you?â€ said the camel. â€œThere are plenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many clouds of smoke. I am not frightened then. I sit still and wait.â€ â€œAnd yet,â€ said Billy, â€œyou dream bad dreams and upset the camp at night.
Well, well!
Before Iâ€™d lie down, not to speak of sitting down, and let a man fire across me, my heels and his head would have something to say to each other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?â€ There was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his big head and said, â€œThis is very foolish indeed. There is only one way of fighting.â€ â€œOh, go on,â€ said Billy. â€œPlease donâ€™t mind me.
I suppose you fellows fight standing on your tails?â€ â€œOnly one way,â€ said the two together. (They must have been twins.) â€œThis is that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon as Two Tails trumpets.â€ (â€œTwo Tailsâ€ is camp slang for the elephant.) â€œWhat does Two Tails trumpet for?â€ said the young mule. â€œTo show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other side. Two Tails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all together--Heya--Hullah! Heeyah!
Hullah!
We do not climb like cats nor run like calves. We go across the level plain, twenty yoke of us, till we are unyoked again, and we graze while the big guns talk across the plain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of the wall fall out, and the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home.â€ â€œOh! And you choose that time for grazing?â€ said the young mule. â€œThat time or any other.
Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked up again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it. Sometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of us are killed, and then there is all the more grazing for those that are left.
This is Fate. None the less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is the proper way to fight. We are brothers from Hapur.
Our father was a sacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.â€ â€œWell, Iâ€™ve certainly learned something tonight,â€ said the troop-horse. â€œDo you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you are being fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?â€ â€œAbout as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all over us, or run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff.
A mountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you pick your own way, and Iâ€™m your mule. But--the other things--no!â€ said Billy, with a stamp of his foot.
â€œOf course,â€ said the troop horse, â€œeveryone is not made in the same way, and I can quite see that your family, on your fatherâ€™s side, would fail to understand a great many things.â€ â€œNever you mind my family on my fatherâ€™s side,â€ said Billy angrily, for every mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey.
â€œMy father was a Southern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every horse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!â€ Brumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of Sunol if a car-horse called her a â€œskate,â€ and you can imagine how the Australian horse felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark. â€œSee here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,â€ he said between his teeth, â€œIâ€™d have you know that Iâ€™m related on my motherâ€™s side to Carbine, winner of the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we arenâ€™t accustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed, pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery.
Are you ready?â€ â€œOn your hind legs!â€ squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each other, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly voice, called out of the darkness to the right--â€œChildren, what are you fighting about there? Be quiet.â€ Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor mule can bear to listen to an elephantâ€™s voice.
â€œItâ€™s Two Tails!â€ said the troop-horse. â€œI canâ€™t stand him. A tail at each end isnâ€™t fair!â€ â€œMy feelings exactly,â€ said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for company. â€œWeâ€™re very alike in some things.â€ â€œI suppose weâ€™ve inherited them from our mothers,â€ said the troop horse.
â€œItâ€™s not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?â€ â€œYes,â€ said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. â€œIâ€™m picketed for the night.
Iâ€™ve heard what you fellows have been saying. But donâ€™t be afraid.
Iâ€™m not coming over.â€ The bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, â€œAfraid of Two Tails--what nonsense!â€ And the bullocks went on, â€œWe are sorry that you heard, but it is true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?â€ â€œWell,â€ said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly like a little boy saying a poem, â€œI donâ€™t quite know whether youâ€™d understand.â€ â€œWe donâ€™t, but we have to pull the guns,â€ said the bullocks. â€œI know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think you are. But itâ€™s different with me.
My battery captain called me a Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day.â€ â€œThatâ€™s another way of fighting, I suppose?â€ said Billy, who was recovering his spirits. â€œYou donâ€™t know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt and between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what will happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks canâ€™t.â€ â€œI can,â€ said the troop-horse.
â€œAt least a little bit.
I try not to think about it.â€ â€œI can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know thereâ€™s a great deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to cure me when Iâ€™m sick. All they can do is to stop my driverâ€™s pay till I get well, and I canâ€™t trust my driver.â€ â€œAh!â€ said the troop horse. â€œThat explains it.
I can trust Dick.â€ â€œYou could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me feel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough to go on in spite of it.â€ â€œWe do not understand,â€ said the bullocks. â€œI know you donâ€™t. Iâ€™m not talking to you.
You donâ€™t know what blood is.â€ â€œWe do,â€ said the bullocks. â€œIt is red stuff that soaks into the ground and smells.â€ The troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.
â€œDonâ€™t talk of it,â€ he said. â€œI can smell it now, just thinking of it. It makes me want to run--when I havenâ€™t Dick on my back.â€ â€œBut it is not here,â€ said the camel and the bullocks. â€œWhy are you so stupid?â€ â€œItâ€™s vile stuff,â€ said Billy.
â€œI donâ€™t want to run, but I donâ€™t want to talk about it.â€ â€œThere you are!â€ said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain. â€œSurely.
Yes, we have been here all night,â€ said the bullocks. Two Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. â€œOh, Iâ€™m not talking to you. You canâ€™t see inside your heads.â€ â€œNo.
We see out of our four eyes,â€ said the bullocks. â€œWe see straight in front of us.â€ â€œIf I could do that and nothing else, you wouldnâ€™t be needed to pull the big guns at all. If I was like my captain--he can see things inside his head before the firing begins, and he shakes all over, but he knows too much to run away--if I was like him I could pull the guns.
But if I were as wise as all that I should never be here.
I should be a king in the forest, as I used to be, sleeping half the day and bathing when I liked.
I havenâ€™t had a good bath for a month.â€ â€œThatâ€™s all very fine,â€ said Billy. â€œBut giving a thing a long name doesnâ€™t make it any better.â€ â€œHâ€™sh!â€ said the troop horse. â€œI think I understand what Two Tails means.â€ â€œYouâ€™ll understand better in a minute,â€ said Two Tails angrily.
â€œNow you just explain to me why you donâ€™t like this!â€ He began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet. â€œStop that!â€ said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could hear them stamp and shiver. An elephantâ€™s trumpeting is always nasty, especially on a dark night.
â€œI shanâ€™t stop,â€ said Two Tails. â€œWonâ€™t you explain that, please?
Hhrrmph! Rrrt!
Rrrmph!
Rrrhha!â€ Then he stopped suddenly, and I heard a little whimper in the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last. She knew as well as I did that if there is one thing in the world the elephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. So she stopped to bully Two Tails in his pickets, and yapped round his big feet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. â€œGo away, little dog!â€ he said.
â€œDonâ€™t snuff at my ankles, or Iâ€™ll kick at you. Good little dog--nice little doggie, then!
Go home, you yelping little beast! Oh, why doesnâ€™t someone take her away? Sheâ€™ll bite me in a minute.â€ â€œSeems to me,â€ said Billy to the troop horse, â€œthat our friend Two Tails is afraid of most things.
Now, if I had a full meal for every dog Iâ€™ve kicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.â€ I whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose, and told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I never let her know that I understood beast talk, or she would have taken all sorts of liberties. So I buttoned her into the breast of my overcoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped and growled to himself.
â€œExtraordinary! Most extraordinary!â€ he said.
â€œIt runs in our family. Now, where has that nasty little beast gone to?â€ I heard him feeling about with his trunk. â€œWe all seem to be affected in various ways,â€ he went on, blowing his nose.
â€œNow, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.â€ â€œNot alarmed, exactly,â€ said the troop-horse, â€œbut it made me feel as though I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Donâ€™t begin again.â€ â€œIâ€™m frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad dreams in the night.â€ â€œIt is very lucky for us that we havenâ€™t all got to fight in the same way,â€ said the troop-horse. â€œWhat I want to know,â€ said the young mule, who had been quiet for a long time--â€œwhat I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.â€ â€œBecause weâ€™re told to,â€ said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt. â€œOrders,â€ said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.
â€œHukm hai!â€ (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two Tails and the bullocks repeated, â€œHukm hai!â€ â€œYes, but who gives the orders?â€ said the recruit-mule. â€œThe man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or holds the nose rope--Or twists your tail,â€ said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel and the bullocks one after the other. â€œBut who gives them the orders?â€ â€œNow you want to know too much, young un,â€ said Billy, â€œand that is one way of getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your head and ask no questions.â€ â€œHeâ€™s quite right,â€ said Two Tails.
â€œI canâ€™t always obey, because Iâ€™m betwixt and between. But Billyâ€™s right.
Obey the man next to you who gives the order, or youâ€™ll stop all the battery, besides getting a thrashing.â€ The gun-bullocks got up to go. â€œMorning is coming,â€ they said. â€œWe will go back to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and we are not very clever.
But still, we are the only people to-night who have not been afraid.
Good-night, you brave people.â€ Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation, â€œWhereâ€™s that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.â€ â€œHere I am,â€ yapped Vixen, â€œunder the gun tail with my man. You big, blundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My manâ€™s very angry.â€ â€œPhew!â€ said the bullocks.
â€œHe must be white!â€ â€œOf course he is,â€ said Vixen. â€œDo you suppose Iâ€™m looked after by a black bullock-driver?â€ â€œHuah! Ouach!
Ugh!â€ said the bullocks. â€œLet us get away quickly.â€ They plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke on the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed. â€œNow you have done it,â€ said Billy calmly.
â€œDonâ€™t struggle.
Youâ€™re hung up till daylight. What on earthâ€™s the matter?â€ The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle give, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.
â€œYouâ€™ll break your necks in a minute,â€ said the troop-horse. â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with white men? I live with â€™em.â€ â€œThey--eat--us!
Pull!â€ said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a twang, and they lumbered off together.
I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen. We eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and of course the cattle do not like it. â€œMay I be flogged with my own pad-chains!
Whoâ€™d have thought of two big lumps like those losing their heads?â€ said Billy. â€œNever mind.
Iâ€™m going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I know, have things in their pockets,â€ said the troop-horse. â€œIâ€™ll leave you, then. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m over-fond of â€™em myself.
Besides, white men who havenâ€™t a place to sleep in are more than likely to be thieves, and Iâ€™ve a good deal of Government property on my back. Come along, young un, and weâ€™ll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia!
See you on parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try to control your feelings, wonâ€™t you? Good-night, Two Tails!
If you pass us on the ground tomorrow, donâ€™t trumpet. It spoils our formation.â€ Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old campaigner, as the troop-horseâ€™s head came nuzzling into my breast, and I gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog, told him fibs about the scores of horses that she and I kept. â€œIâ€™m coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,â€ she said.
â€œWhere will you be?â€ â€œOn the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my troop, little lady,â€ he said politely. â€œNow I must go back to Dick. My tailâ€™s all muddy, and heâ€™ll have two hoursâ€™ hard work dressing me for parade.â€ The big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon, and Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of Afghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star in the center.
The first part of the review was all sunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving together, and guns all in a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the cavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of â€œBonnie Dundee,â€ and Vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The second squadron of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail like spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one back, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly as waltz music.
Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two other elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while twenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and they looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy the mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and his harness was oiled and polished till it winked.
I gave a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule, but he never looked right or left. The rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see what the troops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the plain, and were spreading out into a line.
That line grew and grew and grew till it was three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing--one solid wall of men, horses, and guns. Then it came on straight toward the Viceroy and the Amir, and as it got nearer the ground began to shake, like the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast. Unless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect this steady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they know it is only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he had not shown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else.
But now his eyes began to get bigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his horseâ€™s neck and looked behind him.
For a minute it seemed as though he were going to draw his sword and slash his way out through the English men and women in the carriages at the back. Then the advance stopped dead, the ground stood still, the whole line saluted, and thirty bands began to play all together. That was the end of the review, and the regiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry band struck up with--      The animals went in two by two,           Hurrah!
The animals went in two by two,      The elephant and the battery mulâ€™,      and they all got into the Ark           For to get out of the rain! Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had come down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer. â€œNow,â€ said he, â€œin what manner was this wonderful thing done?â€ And the officer answered, â€œAn order was given, and they obeyed.â€ â€œBut are the beasts as wise as the men?â€ said the chief.
â€œThey obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he obeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his lieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and the captain his major, and the major his colonel, and the colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments, and the brigadier the general, who obeys the Viceroy, who is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is done.â€ â€œWould it were so in Afghanistan!â€ said the chief, â€œfor there we obey only our own wills.â€ â€œAnd for that reason,â€ said the native officer, twirling his mustache, â€œyour Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our Viceroy.â€ The criminal reported a hidden passage near the station early in the morning. The suspect discovered a weapon behind the door late at night. The suspect discovered the body near the station during the storm. The detective found a hidden passage near the station early in the morning.

666 Hebbian learning: associative learning is implemented by simultaneous activation of cells that would lead to increased synaptic strength between the cells 654 Among cognitive models of imitation, the ideomotor model and the associative sequence learning model seem to map well onto neurophysiological mechanisms of imitation. The ideomotor model assumes a common representational format for action and perception, whereas the associative sequence learning model puts at center stage Hebbian learning as a fundamental mechanism linking sensory representations of the actions of others to motor plans. Furthermore, social psychology studies have documented the automaticity of imitation and mimicry in humans, a feature that also maps well onto some recently disclosed neurophysiological bases of imitation. This review discusses cognitive models, social psychology constructs, and neural mechanisms of imitation under the hypothesis that these mechanisms were selected because they offer the adaptive advantage of enabling the understanding of the feelings and mental states of others, a cornerstone of social behavior.
COGNITIVE MECHANISMS OF IMITATION INTRODUCTION The Ideomotor Framework of Imitation Although mimicry is a pervasive phenomenon in the animal kingdom, imitation certainly achieves its highest form in humans.
Past authors—for instance, de Montaigne (1575), Adam Smith (1759), Poe (1982), Nietzsche (1881), and Wittgenstein (1980)—have often associated imitation with the ability to empathize and understand other minds. The evolutionary, functional, and neural mechanisms linking imitation to empathy, however, have been unclear for many years. Recently, there has been a convergence between cognitive models of imitation, social psychology accounts of its pervasiveness and its functional links with empathy and liking, and the neuroscience discoveries of neural mechanisms of imitation and empathy. This convergence creates a solid framework in which theory and empirical data reinforce each other. Theories of action can be divided into two main frameworks.
The most dominant framework may be called the sensory-motor framework of action. It assumes that actions are initiated in response to external stimuli. In this framework, perception and action have independent representational formats. Stimuli must be translated into motor responses by stimulusresponse mapping mechanisms.
This framework has generated a large literature and elegant experimental paradigms, as for instance the work on stimulus-response compatibility (Hommel & Prinz 1997, Proctor & Reeve 1990). Stimulus-response translational mechanisms, however, do not easily account for the similarity between the observed action and the action performed by the imitator that is required by imitation. Indeed, one of the main problems of imitation often discussed in the Iacoboni Annu. Rev. Psychol.

ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 literature inspired by sensory-motor models is the so-called correspondence problem (Nehaniv & Dautenhahn 2002). This problem can be summarized with the question: how is the sensory input from somebody else’s action transformed into a matching motor output by the imitator?
For the ideomotor framework of action, the correspondence problem of imitation is not a problem at all. Indeed, the ideomotor framework assumes a common representational format for perception and action, an assumption that makes translational processes between stimuli and responses rather unnecessary. The roots of the ideomotor framework were established by the work of Hermann Martin Lotze (Prinz 2005) and William James (1890). The starting point of actions, for Lotze and James, is not a response to a sensory stimulation, but rather the representation of the goal that the agent intends to achieve. When an intention is unchallenged by a conﬂicting one, it activates the representation of the intended goal and the motor plan necessary to achieve it.
The coactivation of the intended goal and the motor plan required to achieve it—according to the ideomotor framework—is the result of our experience. We have learned the effects of our own actions, and we expect certain effects when we perform certain acts. This previous learning makes it possible that just thinking about the intended goal automatically activates the representation of the action necessary to obtain it.
Thus, when I think about rebooting my computer, I automatically activate the representation of the ﬁnger movement necessary to press the appropriate key. The ideomotor framework naturally accounts for imitation. According to this framework, when I see somebody else’s actions and their consequences, I activate the representations of my own actions that would produce those consequences. Here, consequences are construed in a very broad sense.
For instance, a simple ﬁnger lifting has multiple perceptual consequences, among them the sight of the ﬁnger lifting. Thus, simply watching somebody else lifting a ﬁnger should activate my own mo- tor plan to lift the same ﬁnger. Brass and colleagues tested this hypothesis in elegantly simple experiments (Brass et al. 2000, 2001).
Subjects were shown two movements of the index ﬁnger from the same starting position. In half of the trials the ﬁnger would move upward, and in the other half it would move downward. Subjects were instructed to respond as fast as possible using their own index ﬁnger. Within each block of trials, subjects were instructed to use always the same motor response, either an upward or a downward movement. Thus, although perceptually subjects were seeing both upward and downward movements, motorically they were only executing one of the two movements.
Given that response selection was not required, the identity of the stimulus was completely irrelevant for the initiation of the motor response. Here, the sensory-motor framework would predict similar reaction times for responses that were identical to the stimulus (e.g., upward motor response for a stimulus showing an upward ﬁnger movement) and for responses that were different from the stimulus (e.g., upward motor response for a stimulus showing a downward ﬁnger movement). In contrast, the ideomotor framework would predict faster reaction times for motor responses identical to the stimulus compared to motor responses different from the stimulus. The results demonstrated a large chronometric advantage for responses identical to the stimuli, in line with the predictions of the ideomotor framework (Brass et al. 2000, 2001).
The ideomotor framework also predicts that goals have higher priority than movements in imitation. Imitation experiments in children have conﬁrmed this prediction. In one of these experiments (Bekkering et al. 2000), children and experimenters were sitting on the opposite sides of a desk.
In half of the trials the experimenter would place her or his left hand on the left side of the desk (left ipsilateral movement) or on the right side of the desk (left contralateral movement); in the remaining half of the trials the experimenter would place her or his right hand on the right side of the desk (right ipsilateral movement) or on the left side of the desk www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons 655 ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 Annu.

Associative sequence learning: imitation is based on associative, Hebbian-like learning, creating “vertical links” between sensory and motor representations 18:59 (right contralateral movement). Children were instructed to “Do what I do,” and in all cases, they imitated all these movements well. In a separate session, children and experimenters were again sitting on the opposite sides of the desk. Now, however, there were two big red dots, one on the left and one on the right side of the desk. Whenever the experimenter made a movement, either ipsilateral or contralateral with either the left or the right hand, the hand of the experimenter would end up covering the big red dot.
Children were again instructed to “Do what I do.” In this situation, children imitated well the ipsilateral movements but made frequent mistakes when trying to imitate the contralateral movements. Note that these movements had been imitated well in absence of the big red dot. The presence of the big red dot had changed the goal of the action to be imitated. Whereas in the absence of the dot, the action itself was the goal to be imitated, the presence of the dot had changed the goal of the action in covering the dot.
Indeed, children made mistakes when imitating contralateral movements because they used ipsilateral movements to cover the same dot that had been covered by the experimenter. In other words, children would copy the goal but used a simpler movement to achieve this goal (Bekkering et al. 2000). One of the main assumptions of the ideomotor framework is that action and perception share a common representational format. This assumption ﬁts well recent neuroscience discoveries, as discussed below.
Another important assumption of the ideomotor framework is that our perceptual and motor experience is very important in shaping the functional aspects of imitation. This assumption is also shared by the associative sequence learning model (Heyes 2005), as described in the next section. Associative Sequence Learning The associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that imitative abilities are based on associations between the sensory and motor representation of actions. These associations would be mostly shaped by experience, 656 Iacoboni although a small number of these associations may be innate. Several environmental situations may favor the establishment of these associations between sensory and motor representation of actions, for instance, visually guided actions, such as reaching and grasping, during which we can observe our own arm and hand reach and grasp for objects surrounding us.
Also, mirrors and other reﬂecting surfaces allow the observation of one’s own facial and body movement as if they were performed by somebody else. Furthermore, early in human development, adults tend to imitate the baby (Nadel 2002), thus favoring the formation of the associations between sensory and motor representations of actions. The basic assumption of the associative sequence learning model is that imitation is not based on dedicated functional (and neural) mechanisms. General sensory and motor systems may implement imitative abilities through mechanisms that are strongly reminiscent of Hebbian learning. One of the corollaries of this assumption is that imitation should not be conﬁned to speciﬁc lineages.
Indeed, although primates clearly show varying degrees of imitative abilities, birds (Akins et al. 2002) and dolphins (Herman 2002) also seem able to imitate. Thus, imitative behavior appears to be the product of convergent evolution. If this is true, then the hypothesis that imitation is mostly shaped by experience—as assumed by the associative sequence learning model—is obviously supported. The role of experience and the environment in shaping imitative abilities may also account for evidence that at ﬁrst sight seems at odds with the basic assumptions of the associative sequence learning model.
Many animals share similar basic sensory and motor functional and neural mechanisms. In principle, this should lead to similar imitative skills in many animals. Imitation abilities, however, vary substantially between species (Boysen & Himes 1999, Hurley & Chater 2005).
Is this evidence a fatal blow to the main assumption of the associative sequence learning model? Probably not.
Indeed, different kinds of environments may Annu. Rev. Psychol.

As discussed above, some elements that are quite speciﬁc to the human environment should favor the formation of the associations between sensory and motor representations posited by the associative sequence learning model. In keeping with these ideas, humans are by far the best imitators (Hurley & Chater 2005). Empirical evidence in well-controlled laboratory experiments seems to support the role of experience in shaping imitation, as hypothesized by the associative sequence learning model.
For instance, hand-opening and handclosing gestures are typically facilitated by the observation of the same movement compared to the observation of a different movement. However, this facilitation can be abolished by a relatively short period of training during which subjects are instructed to open the hand while observing hand closing, and to close the hand while observing hand opening (Heyes et al.
2005).
In another experiment, the effect of training was measured on the speed of imitation induced by the observation of human motion versus robotic motion. A typical ﬁnding is that humans imitate more quickly the movements of another human compared to the movements of a robot. This effect, however, may be simply because humans tend to interact more with other humans than with robots. Indeed, subjects who were trained to execute hand movement in response to a robotic movement demonstrated no difference in speed of imitation while observing human and robotic movements (Press et al.
2007).
Although the associative sequence learning model and the ideomotor framework of imitation share the main idea that experience is extremely important for imitation, they also seem to differ on an important point.
The associative sequence learning model assumes that separate sensory and motor representations are linked by experience. In contrast, the ideomotor framework assumes that sensory and motor functional mechanisms share a common represen- tational format. In psychological terms, these differences are not negligible. The translation of these different concepts into neural activity, however, as discussed below, may not differ dramatically (Glimcher 2005).
Indeed, the main assumptions of both the associative sequence learning model and the ideomotor framework of imitation ﬁt well with recent neuroscience ﬁndings on imitation.
IMITATION AND EMPATHY IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR Pervasiveness and Automaticity of Human Imitation Humans seem to have a strong tendency to align their behavior with their fellows during social interactions (Lieberman 2007). Some of these forms of imitation and mimicry are not only pervasive and automatic, but also operate on a quite complex level. Ap Dijksterius (2005)— following LeDoux’s terminology on processing of fearful stimuli (LeDoux 1996)—suggests that there are two roads to human imitation. A low road leads to imitation in a direct fashion, such that the perceiver acts the gestures, postures, facial expressions, and speech perceived in other people.
A high road leads to complex and rather subtle forms of imitation, as shown by a number of experiments with priming manipulations that lead to stereotype activation or trait activation. An example of stereotype activation on motor behavior is provided by the following experiment. Participants performed a scrambled-sentence language task. Some subjects were exposed to words such as Florida, bingo, gray; that is, words typically associated with the elderly. Some other subjects were not.
After the experiment, participants left the laboratory and walked back to the elevator to leave the building. An experimenter timed this walk back to the elevator. Subjects who had been primed with the elderly stereotype were reliably slower than subjects who had not been primed (Bargh et al. 1996). The primed subjects www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons 657 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 imitated—obviously in an unconscious way— the slowness of old people.
The high road to imitation is also at work in memory and general knowledge tasks. In one experiment, subjects sat in front of a desk full of objects. The stereotype of the elderly was primed again in some subjects by asking them questions on elderly people.
Other subjects, in contrast, were asked questions about college students. Subsequently, subjects were transferred to another room and were asked to remember the objects that were on the desk in front of them. The subjects primed with the elderly stereotype remembered far fewer objects than did the other participants (Dijksterhuis et al. 2000). In a series of experiments, participants were either asked to think about college professors (a group of people typically associated with intelligence) and to write down everything that came to mind about college professors, or they were asked to think about soccer hooligans (a group of people typically not associated with intelligence) and to write down everything that came to mind about soccer hooligans. In a later task involving general knowledge questions, a task that was ostensibly unrelated to the ﬁrst one, the participants who were asked to think about college professors outperformed the participants who were asked to think about soccer hooligans.
Indeed, the participants who were asked to think about college professors even outperformed participants who were not asked anything at all, and the participants who were asked to think about soccer hooligans were outperformed by participants who were not asked anything at all (Dijksterhuis & van Knippenberg 1998). Many more studies support the concept that the high road to imitation is pervasive and automatic (Dijksterhuis 2005). The question is why pervasiveness and automaticity have been selected as distinctive properties of the high road to imitation. One possibility is that imitation facilitates social interactions, increases connectedness and liking, gets people closer to each other, and fosters mutual care.

ANRV364-PS60-25 658 Iacoboni is correct, it should follow that good imitators should also be good at recognizing emotions in other people, which in turn may lead to greater empathy. Thus, this account would predict a correlation between the tendency to imitate others and the ability to empathize with them. This hypothesis was tested in a series of experiments (Chartrand & Bargh 1999).
In the ﬁrst experiment, subjects were asked to choose pictures in a set of photographs. The cover story was that the researchers needed some of these pictures for a psychological test and wanted to know from the subjects which pictures they considered more stimulating. While subjects were choosing the pictures, a confederate was sitting in the same room with the real subject.
The confederate pretended to be another subject who was also choosing good stimulating pictures. During the experimental sessions, some confederates deliberately rubbed their nose while the others shook their foot. Subjects were videotaped and their motor behavior was measured. It was found that the real subjects unintentionally mimicked the motor behavior of the confederate with whom they were sharing the room.
Subjects who shared the room with confederates who rubbed their nose, rubbed their nose more than did subjects who shared the room with confederates who shook their foot. Furthermore, subjects who shared the room with confederates who shook their foot, shook their foot more than did subjects who shared the room with confederates who rubbed their nose. These results are in line with the idea that imitation is automatic and provide the necessary prelude to the following experiments. The second experiment tested the hypothesis that one of the functions of this automatic tendency to imitate is to increase liking between individuals.
Participants were again asked to choose pictures, and confederates were again sitting with them, pretending to be participants of the study. In this second experiment, the cover task required participants and confederates to take turns in describing what they saw in various photos. At the end of the interaction Annu.

ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 between participants and confederates, the participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire to report how much they liked the other participant (that is, the confederate) and how smoothly they thought the interaction had gone. In this second experiment, the confederates either imitated the spontaneous postures, movements, and mannerisms of the subjects or kept a neutral posture. The participants who were mimicked by confederates during the interaction liked the confederates much more than did the participants who were not imitated.
Furthermore, mimicked subjects rated the smoothness of the interaction higher than did the participants who were not imitated. This experiment demonstrated that imitation and liking tend to go together. When someone is imitating us, we tend to like him or her more.
A third experiment tested the hypothesis that the more people tend to imitate others, the more they are concerned with the feelings of other people. The setting of this third experiment was identical to the ﬁrst experiment. The novel aspect of this last experiment was that the participants responded to a questionnaire that measured their empathic tendencies. The experiment found a strong correlation between the tendency to empathize and the amount of imitative behavior displayed by the participants.
The more a subject imitated the confederate, the more that subject was an empathic individual (Chartrand & Bargh 1999). This result suggests that through imitation and mimicry, we are able to feel what other people feel. By being able to feel what other people feel, we are also able to respond compassionately to other people’s emotional states (Eisenberg 2000, Tangney et al. 2007). Many other empirical results are consistent with these ideas (Braten 2007, Niedenthal et al. 2005).
What are the neural correlates of these complex forms of human behavior? A recent discovery in the monkey premotor cortex has sparked a whole series of new studies, in monkeys and humans, that are relevant to this question. NEURAL MECHANISMS OF IMITATION Neural Precursors in Nonhuman Primates The premotor cortex of the macaque brain, a cortical region important for the planning, preparation, and selection of movements and coordinated actions, is not homogeneous (Matelli et al. 1985).
It is composed of several cito-architectonic ﬁelds with different physiological properties. In the lateral wall of the macaque brain, the ventral sector of the premotor cortex is composed of two main ﬁelds, area F4 and area F5 (Matelli et al. 1985). Area F5 has physiological properties relevant to the neural control of mouth and hand movements, especially grasping (Rizzolatti et al. 1988). Within area F5, there are neurons that discharge not only when the monkey performs goal-oriented actions such as grasping an object, holding it, manipulating it, and bringing it to the mouth, but also when the monkey, completely still, simply observes somebody else performing these actions.
Because of these properties, which almost suggest that the monkey is observing its own actions reﬂected by a mirror, these cells were called mirror neurons (di Pellegrino et al.
1992, Gallese et al. 1996).
The properties of mirror neurons call to mind the concepts of the ideomotor framework of actions, according to which perception and action share common representational formats. Indeed, mirror neurons embody the overlap between perception and action predicted by the ideomotor framework by discharging both during action execution and during action observation. The initial hypothesis about the functional role of mirror neurons focused on action recognition. By ﬁring during actions of the self and of other individuals, mirror neurons may provide a remarkably simple neural mechanism for recognizing the actions of others. Early observations on ﬁring-rate changes in mirror neurons demonstrated that these cells do not ﬁre at the sight of a pantomime (Rizzolatti et al. 1996, www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons Premotor cortex: anterior sector of the agranular frontal cortex containing neurons that are relevant to the planning, preparation, and selection of actions Mirror neurons: neurons with motor properties in premotor and posterior parietal cortex that ﬁre not only during action execution, but also while observing somebody else performing the same or a similar action 659 ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 Annu.

Strictly congruent mirror neurons: mirror neurons that ﬁre during the observation of exactly the same action they code motorically Broadly congruent mirror neurons: mirror neurons that ﬁre during the observation of an action achieving the same goal or logically related to the action they code motorically 660 18:59 Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998). For instance, the pantomime of whole-hand grasp (when the whole hand is used to grasp a relatively large object, as an orange) does not trigger the discharge of a mirror neuron that ﬁres during execution and observation of whole-hand grasps. This makes sense because monkeys typically do not pantomime. These early ﬁndings suggested that the properties of this neural system were remarkable but relatively simple, some sort of “monkey see, monkey do” neural mechanisms.
However, many other ﬁndings contradict this view and rather suggest that mirror neurons form a sophisticated, nuanced system for shared coding of motor and perceptual aspects of actions of self and others (Rizzolatti & Craighero 2004).
For instance, although the term “mirror” implies a strong similarity between the executed and the observed actions, only one third of mirror neurons—the so-called strictly congruent mirror neurons—ﬁre for the same executed and observed action. The remaining two-thirds of mirror neurons—the so-called broadly congruent mirror neurons—ﬁre for executed and observed actions that are not the same but either achieve the same goal or are logically related (di Pellegrino et al. 1992, Gallese et al.
1996, Rizzolatti & Craighero 2004), thus forming some sort of sequence of acts, as for instance observed placing food on the table and executed grasping food and bringing it to the mouth. The properties of broadly congruent mirror neurons suggest that these cells provide a ﬂexible coding of actions of self and others. This ﬂexibility is an important property for successful social interactions because even though imitation is a pervasive phenomenon in humans, people do not imitate each other all the time but rather often perform coordinated, cooperative, complementary actions. Broadly congruent mirror neurons seem ideal cells to support cooperative behavior among people (NewmanNorlund et al. 2007).
Following the initial observations (di Pellegrino et al. 1992, Gallese et al. 1996), a series of more recent experiments have demonstrated other complex properties of mirror neurons. For instance, we often easily recognize actions Iacoboni that are partially occluded. The role of mirror neurons in the recognition of hidden actions was tested by using a screen that occluded the completion of the grasping action (Umiltà et al.
2001). In two baseline conditions, the ﬁring of the cells was measured for observation of grasping and of grasp pantomime.
As expected, mirror neurons ﬁred for grasping observation but not for observation of the pantomime. In a new experimental condition, the subject watched a graspable object placed on a desk in front of the monkey. Subsequently, a screen occluded the sight of the graspable object and a human experimenter reached with her or his hand behind the screen. The monkey was able to see the experimenter’s hand moving toward the object but was not able to see the actual grasping action, which was occluded by the screen.
Approximately half of the mirror neurons tested in this experiment discharged even though the grasping action was occluded. The ﬁring rate changes of these neurons were tested also in an additional control condition. Here, at the beginning of the trial, the monkey saw that there was no graspable object on the table.
As in the previous experimental conditions, a screen subsequently occluded the sight of the table and a human experimenter reached with her or his hand behind the screen. Consider that at this point, this additional control condition is visually identical to the previous experimental conditions involving the screen occluding the sight of the grasping action. The only difference here is the prior knowledge of the absence of a graspable object behind the screen. Mirror neurons tested under this experimental condition did not change their ﬁring rate, suggesting that the unseen action behind the screen was indeed coded as a pantomime (or, better, as a nongrasping action) (Umiltà et al. 2001). The experiment on hidden actions demonstrates another aspect of the properties of mirror neurons that suggests that these cells code actions in a fairly sophisticated way.
The same visual information is coded differently, on the basis of prior knowledge about the presence or absence of a graspable object behind the screen. A subsequent experiment Annu.

ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 demonstrated that mirror neurons also code in absence of any visual input (Kohler et al.
2002). In this study, after the necessary baseline conditions were performed and mirror neurons were identiﬁed, the experimenters measured the ﬁring-rate changes of mirror neurons to the sound of actions. The sound stimuli used in this study were associated with common actions such as tearing a piece of paper, breaking peanuts, and so on.
Control sounds not associated with actions, for instance white noise, were also used (Keysers et al. 2003, Kohler et al. 2002). The single-cell recordings demonstrated that mirror neurons can also discharge to the sound of an action, even in absence of the visual input related to the action. These auditory properties of mirror neurons have two important theoretical implications. One implication is relevant to the evolution of language. Area F5 of the macaque brain (where mirror neurons were originally discovered) is the anatomical homologue of Brodmann area 44 of the human brain (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998), a brain area with important language properties.
This anatomical correspondence, together with other considerations, led to the hypothesis that mirror neurons may have facilitated the emergence of language in the human brain (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998). However, language is not only written and read but also (and mostly) spoken and heard.
Mirror neuron responses to auditory stimuli are essential evidence for the hypothesis that mirror neurons are important neural elements in language evolution. The other implication of the auditory properties of mirror neurons is that they show that mirror neurons are multimodal cells. This functional property is theoretically important because it is compatible with associative models of how mirror neurons may be formed, which is discussed in more detail below. When we break a peanut, the visual input of our ﬁngers breaking the peanut and the auditory input of the sound of breaking the peanut almost always co-occur, especially when we are initially learning to perform the action.
Associative models can easily account for multimodal responses that are produced by the co-occurrence of sensory stimuli from multiple modalities (Fanselow & Poulos 2005, Keysers & Perrett 2004, Wasserman & Miller 1997). A recent study on mirror neuron responses to the sight of actions involving the use of tools is also consistent with the hypothesis that the properties of mirror neurons are shaped by experience. Early observations on mirror neuron responses to observed actions suggested that these cells do not ﬁre at the sight of an action involving the use of a tool.
For instance, a mirror neuron discharging during the execution and observation of precision grips (when grasping small objects with two ﬁngers) would not ﬁre at the sight of the experimenter using a hand tool such as a pliers to grasp the same small object (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998). However, a recent study recording in the inferolateral aspect of area F5 has reported robust discharges in approximately 20% of recorded mirror neurons when the monkey observed the experimenters using tools (Ferrari et al. 2005).
Indeed, these discharges were even more robust than the discharges of the same cells during the observation of a grasping action without the tool (Ferrari et al. 2005). Although it is not possible to demonstrate unequivocally that the mirror neuron responses to tool use actions were acquired through the daily experience of observing human experimenters using tools in the lab, this seems a likely explanation.
It is unlikely that tool-use mirror neurons were already present in area F5 of the macaque brain but never recorded for more than ten years. This recently discovered functional property of mirror neurons and its likely underlying forming mechanisms is also obviously relevant to the psychological theories discussed above. Furthermore, described above, the ideomotor framework of action puts intentions front and center. Is it possible that the discharge of mirror neurons may represent the coding of the intention associated with the performed and observed action rather than the action itself?
A recent single-cell recording study has addressed this question (Fogassi et al. 2005). The depth electrode recordings ﬁrst demonstrated that neurons in area PF/PFG—a cortical www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons 661 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 area located in the anterior part of the inferior parietal lobule that is anatomically connected with area F5 in the ventral premotor cortex (see Figure 1) and that also contains mirror neurons—had differential discharges for the same grasping action that led to, say, eating food rather than placing the food in a container (note that the monkeys were rewarded after placing the food in the container; thus, the amount of reward was identical for both actions). Not surprisingly, grasping for eating was preferred by the majority of grasping cells in this parietal area, although approximately 25% of neurons coding differently the same grasping action on the basis of its intention preferred grasping for placing over grasping for eating (Fogassi et al.
2005). This pattern of ﬁring-rate changes demonstrates that these cells code the same executed grasping action rather differently, according to the intention (or the goal) associated with the grasping action.
The same pattern of ﬁringrate changes was also observed during action observation. Here, the monkey was simply observing the human experimenter performing grasping actions. The intention of the experimenter was cued by the presence of a container. When the container was present, the experimenter grasped the food and placed it in the container. When the container was absent, the experimenter grasped the food and ate it.
At the time of grasping, the cells that discharged more robustly for grasping to eat when the monkey performed the actions also discharged more robustly when the monkey simply observed the human experimenter grasping the food in order to eat it. Likewise, the cells that discharged more robustly for grasping to place when the monkey performed the actions also discharged more robustly when the monkey simply observed the human experimenter grasping the food in order to place it in the container (Fogassi et al. 2005). Thus, rather than coding the observed grasping action, these neurons seem to be coding the goal associated with the action, the intention to eat or to place. The most dramatic demonstration of the role of goal coding in these cells has been pro- Annu.

ANRV364-PS60-25 662 Iacoboni vided by a very recent study (Umiltà et al. 2008). Here, single-cell recordings in area F5 were performed after monkeys were trained to use pliers to grasp objects. Ventral premotor neurons active during grasping actions were also active when the monkey used pliers to grasp objects.
Monkeys were trained to use reverse pliers that required hand opening rather than hand closing (as in natural grasps). Remarkably, neurons that ﬁred during hand closing in natural grasps and during use of normal pliers did ﬁre during hand opening when the monkeys used the reverse pliers. The activity of these motor neurons is evidently centered on coding the goal of the action rather than the motor detail of hand closing or opening. Among these motor neurons, the cells with mirroring properties also demonstrated a pattern of ﬁringrate changes centered on goal coding, discharging when the tips of the pliers were closing on the objects to be grasped during observation of action with both normal and reverse pliers (Umiltà et al. 2008).
Mirror neurons do not mirror only grasping actions performed with the hand or with tools controlled by the hand. There is evidence of mirror neurons coding facial actions, in particular with the mouth. Both ingestive (such as biting and sucking) and communicative actions are coded by mirror neurons (Ferrari et al. 2003).
This is especially important for the hypothesis that mirror neurons may facilitate our understanding of the emotions of other people, because the face is the body part that we use most often to express our own emotions. Macaque Mirror Neurons and Imitation in Monkeys Do monkeys imitate? This is a contentious issue, and the answer to this question is heavily dependent on the deﬁnition of imitation.
Among scholars, it was widely held at the end of the nineteenth century that monkeys not only are able to imitate, but they actually do it “. . . at ludicrous length.” (Romanes 1883).
In those times, imitation was not typically associated with high forms of intelligence. This Annu.

ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 view of imitation has changed considerably in the past 30 years (Hurley & Chater 2005), calling also for a revision of previously held ideas on monkeys’ ability to imitate. Indeed, such revision had at some point taken the form of a true backlash, with many scholars denying that monkeys had any imitative ability. This position raised the issue of what is the adaptive advantage of mirror neurons for monkeys and inspired new and better-controlled studies. There is now well-controlled evidence that monkeys are indeed able to imitate (Ferrari et al.
2006; Subiaul et al. 2004; Voelkl & Huber 2000, 2007), and it is likely—although there is no direct evidence yet—that this ability is supported by mirror neurons.
For instance, marmosets observed a demonstrator removing the lids from a series of plastic canisters to obtain a mealworm. Subsequently, marmosets that observed a demonstrator using its hands to remove the lids used only their hands, whereas marmosets that observed a demonstrator using its mouth used their mouth to remove the lids (Voelkl & Huber 2000). In another study, marmosets observed another marmoset (the model) that was previously trained to open a box in a peculiar way. Detailed motion analyses demonstrated that the highly unusual movement pattern of the model was faithfully replicated by the observers (Voelkl & Huber 2007). A recent study has also shown that rhesus macaques display neonatal imitation abilities that are similar to the abilities displayed by human neonates (Ferrari et al. 2006).
It is evident, however, that imitative learning is not developed in monkeys as it is in humans (Hurley & Chater 2005). What then would be the main function of mirror neurons in the monkey brain? One possibility might be that mirror neurons facilitate the ability to recognize the actions of others. A recent behavioral study, however, has also revealed that monkeys are able to recognize when they are being imitated (Paukner et al. 2005).
In this study, monkeys observed two experimenters, each manipulating a wooden cube with a hole in each side. Initially, the monkeys did not show any preferential looking between the two experimenters. Subsequently, a cube was given to the monkey. When the monkey started manipulating the cube, one of the two experimenters imitated accurately the monkey’s actions directed at the cube. The second experimenter, in contrast, performed different actions.
At this point, the monkey preferentially looked at the experimenter imitating her own actions. This capacity, which is likely supported by mirror neurons, may have an important social function and may be one of the early functional precursors of the highly developed imitative behavior of humans. TMS: transcranial magnetic stimulation BOLD: bloodoxygenation-level dependent fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging Human Brain Mechanisms of Mirroring The exquisite spatial and temporal resolution afforded by depth electrode recordings of single-cell activity can be obtained only with techniques of brain investigation that are quite invasive. These techniques cannot typically be used in humans.
The neural properties revealed by single-unit recordings in monkeys are usually investigated in humans at the system level, with lesion studies (behavioral observations on neurological patients), brain imaging, and recently transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Although the relationships between all these markers of brain activity are far from being fully deﬁned, there is evidence that they tend to correlate relatively well.
Spiking neuronal activity recorded with in-depth electrodes correlates well with the blood-oxygenationlevel dependent (BOLD) signal measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Logothetis et al. 2001). In some cases, however, spiking activity and BOLD seem to dissociate (Logothetis & Wandell 2004), for instance when spiking responses show adaptation (that is, a reduced response to repeated stimuli) while BOLD does not (Goense & Logothetis 2008). Nevertheless, a recent TMS study has shown similar stimulation effects on both neural and hemodynamic signals (Allen et al. 2007), supporting the practice of inferring neural activity from signals based on hemodynamic changes, such as BOLD fMRI.

ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 Pars opercularis: posterior sector of the inferior frontal gyrus delimited superiorly by the inferior frontal sulcus, inferiorly by the Sylvian ﬁssure, posteriorly by the ventral sector of the precentral gyrus, and anteriorly by the ascending branch of the Sylvian ﬁssure. Pars opercularis in the left hemisphere is classically considered the posterior part of Broca’s area, a major language area of the human brain 664 18:59 Indeed, this practice is widely used in systems neuroscience. For instance, single-cell recordings with depth electrodes have revealed in the dorsal premotor cortex of macaques cellular mechanisms of conditional motor learning, the fundamental ability that allows the association of motor responses to arbitrary sensory stimuli, as when we brake at a red trafﬁc light.
In humans, the dorsal premotor cortex has also been associated with conditional motor learning by brain imaging and lesion studies (Passingham 1993). Even though single-cell recordings of human dorsal premotor neurons have not been performed, the obvious assumption is that the human brain must have dorsal premotor cellular mechanisms that enable conditional motor learning and that are likely similar to—albeit probably more sophisticated than—the ones recorded in monkeys. This very same logic applies to the investigation of mirror neurons in the human brain. Given that the information typically obtained in human studies is at system level, the term “mirror neuron system” is often used in these studies.
Two positron emission tomography studies (Grafton et al. 1996, Rizzolatti et al. 1996) and a TMS study (Fadiga et al. 1995) provided early evidence compatible with the idea that the human ventral premotor and inferior frontal cortex had mirroring properties. However, these studies did not investigate the role of these human brain areas in imitation.
In a later fMRI study (Iacoboni et al. 1999), subjects were required to imitate simple ﬁnger movements and to perform motor and visual control tasks. The logic of the study was as follows: The neuronal discharge measured by depth electrode recordings in macaques during action observation is approximately 50% of the discharge measured during action execution (Gallese et al. 1996). Thus, human brain areas with mirror neurons should also have an increased BOLD signal (which roughly correlates with brain activity in fMRI) during action observation that is approximately 50% of the BOLD increase measured during action execution. Furthermore, during imitation, subjects were simultaneously watch- Iacoboni ing the ﬁnger movement and copying it.
Thus, mirror neuron areas may have a BOLD signal increase during imitation that is approximately the sum of the BOLD signal increases observed during action observation and during action execution. The fMRI study found that two cortical areas had this predicted pattern of activity: They were located in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus and in the rostral part of the posterior parietal cortex (Iacoboni et al. 1999), in anatomical locations (Figure 2) that were homologous to the anatomical locations of the macaque brain areas with mirror neurons, that is, area F5 in the ventral premotor cortex and area PF/PFG in the rostral sector of the inferior parietal lobule. The inferior frontal area with mirroring properties overlapped with the posterior part of Broca’s area, a major language area.
On one hand, these ﬁndings supported the evolutionary hypothesis about the role of mirror neurons in language (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998). On the other hand, an activation in a language area during a nonlanguage task may be induced by covert verbalization occurring during the activation tasks. It is unclear why imitation should induce more covert verbalization than motor execution, which in turn should induce more covert verbalization than action observation (the pattern predicted for a mirror neuron area and observed in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus and in the rostral part of the posterior parietal cortex), and this issue cannot be conclusively resolved by fMRI, which is a technique that provides only correlational data between brain areas and human behavior.
TMS, on the other hand, provides information on the causal role of the activity in a brain area and human behavior. A high-frequency repetitive TMS study indeed demonstrated later that activity in the pars opercularis, the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus, is essential to imitation (Heiser et al. 2003). A series of brain-imaging studies has suggested a core cortical circuitry for imitation composed of the posterior part of the superior Annu. Rev. Psychol.

Within this cortical circuitry, the superior temporal cortex would provide a higher-order visual description of the actions of other people and would feed this information to the fronto-parietal mirror neuron areas (Iacoboni et al. 2001). The parietal mirror neuron area would code the motor aspect of the action (Iacoboni et al. 1999), whereas the frontal mirror neuron area would be more concerned with the goal of the action (Iacoboni 2005, Iacoboni et al. 2005, Iacoboni & Dapretto 2006, Koski et al. 2002). Imitative behavior can take many forms (Hurley & Chater 2005).
The core circuitry for imitation, composed of superior temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal cortex, interacts with other neural systems to support different forms of imitative behavior. For instance, the interactions between the core circuitry for imitation and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seem critical during imitative learning (Buccino et al. 2004). In contrast, social mirroring and the ability to empathize with others may be supported by the interactions between the core circuitry for imitation and the limbic system (Iacoboni 2005). An fMRI study of imitation and observation of facial emotional expressions (Carr et al. 2003) tested the hypothesis that empathy is enabled by a large-scale neural network composed of the mirror neuron system, the limbic system, and the insula connecting these two neural systems.
Within this network, mirror neurons would support the simulation of the facial expressions observed in other people, which in turn would trigger activity in limbic areas, thus producing in the observer the emotion that other people are feeling. This model predicts activation of mirror neuron areas, insula, and limbic areas during both observation and imitation of facial emotional expressions. Furthermore, the model predicts that the increased activity in mirror neuron ar- eas during imitation should also spread to insula and limbic areas, if these brain centers are indeed functionally connected with mirror neuron areas. Both predictions were supported by the empirical ﬁndings (Carr et al. 2003).
In functional terms, the large-scale network composed of mirror neuron areas, insula, and the limbic system likely provides a simulation-based form of empathy (Goldman 2006, Goldman & Sripada 2005). Recent data also suggest that the activity in this network provides a biomarker of sociality and empathy. Indeed, an fMRI study of imitation and observation of facial expressions in children with autism and in typically developing children demonstrated not only a deﬁcit in mirror neuron areas in the children with autism, but also a correlation between the severity of the disease and activity in these areas: The lower the activity in mirror neuron areas, the more severe the autism (Dapretto et al. 2006). Furthermore, a separate fMRI study on typically developing preadolescents—in which the activation task was again the observation and imitation of facial emotional expressions—has recently demonstrated that activity in mirror neuron areas was positively correlated with interpersonal competence and empathic concern (Pfeifer et al. 2008).
Two additional fMRI studies on adults also support the ﬁndings obtained in children. In one study, subjects observed simple grasping actions (Kaplan & Iacoboni 2006). In the other study, subjects listened to action sounds (Gazzola et al. 2006).
Both studies found a positive correlation between empathy scores and activity in premotor areas activated during action observation and while listening to action sounds, thus likely containing mirror neurons. Neural Mirroring and Psychological Theories of Imitation The ideomotor model of imitation and the associative sequence learning model share many concepts but diverge on a fundamental one: The former assumes overlap between www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons 665 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 perceptual and motor representations, whereas the latter assumes that sensory and motor representations are separated but functionally connected through vertical links formed by associative learning. Both models also map well onto the functional properties of mirror neurons and neural systems for mirroring. Do the neuroscience ﬁndings on mirror neurons better support the assumptions of the ideomotor model on perceptual and motor representations or those of the associative sequence learning model?
It is difﬁcult to answer this question because the levels of description of psychological theories and those of neuroscience empirical work are radically different. The discharge of mirror neurons during action execution and action observation seems to fulﬁll the main assumption of the ideomotor model, a common representational format for perception and action. Preliminary results on individual neuronal activity obtained with depth electrode recordings in humans (R.
Mukamel, A. Ekstrom, J. Kaplan, M. Iacoboni and I. Fried, unpublished observations) seem also to support the ideomotor model.
Using a rare clinical opportunity, we recently recorded single-cell activity in epileptic patients implanted for surgical evaluation. We found human neurons with mirror properties in the frontal lobe as well as in the medial temporal cortex. Although the discharge of these cells during action execution and action observation seems to imply a common representational format for perception and action implemented at single cell level, it is also true that lesions in the frontal lobe are more often associated with motor deﬁcits, and lesions in the medial temporal lobe are more often associated with perceptual deﬁcits.
Perception and action, which are united at the level of single cells, seem to be more easily separated at the system level. In principle, the discharge during action execution and during action observation of frontal and medial temporal neurons may represent in neural terms the “vertical links” posited by the associative sequence learning model between a sensory unit (the medial temporal neuron) and Annu.

ANRV364-PS60-25 666 Iacoboni a motor unit (the frontal neuron) that ﬁre together as a result of associative learning. WHY NEURAL MIRRORING AND IMITATION? The fundamental Darwinian question is why mirror neurons were selected by evolution. What is the adaptive advantage of having these neurons?
The properties of these cells seem to solve—or better, dis-solve—what is called the “problem of other minds”: if one has access only to one’s own mind, how can one possibly understand the minds of other people? How can one possibly share one’s own mental states with others, making intersubjectivity possible? A classical solution to the problem of other minds is the so-called argument from analogy.
The argument from analogy posits that we ﬁrst observe certain relations between our mental states and our bodily states and then ﬁnd an analogy between our body and the body of other people. If there is an analogy between our body and the body of others, there may be also an analogy between our mental states/bodily states relations and those of other people. This way of reasoning about the mental states of other people seems too complex for something we seem to accomplish so naturally, effortlessly, and quickly. Mirror neurons, in contrast, provide a prereﬂective, automatic mechanism of mirroring what is going on in the brain of other people that seems more compatible with our ability to understand others effortlessly and with our tendency to imitate others automatically, as we have discussed in this review.
A further implication of the recent work on the relationships between mirror neurons, imitation, and empathy is the consideration that the evolutionary process made us wired for empathy. This is a major revision of widely held beliefs. Traditionally, our biology is considered the basis of self-serving individualism, whereas our ideas and our social codes enable us to rise above our neurobiological makeup. The research on mirror neurons, imitation, and empathy, in contrast, tells us that our ANRV364-PS60-25 ARI 24 November 2008 18:59 ability to empathize, a building block of our sociality (Adolphs 2009) and morality (de Waal 2008, Tangney et al. 2007), has been built “bot- tom up” from relatively simple mechanisms of action production and perception (Iacoboni 2008).

How do we understand other people’s behavior? How can we assign goals, intentions, or beliefs to the inhabitants of our social world? A possible way to answer these challenging questions is to adopt an evolutionary frame of reference, both in phylogenetical and ontogenetical terms, envisaging these ‘mind-reading’ capacities as rooted in antecedent, more ‘ancient’ and simple mechanisms. This approach can capitalize on the results of different fields of investigation: neurophysiology can investigate the neural correlates of precursors of these mechanisms in lower species of social primates such as macaque monkeys. Developmental psychology can study how the capacity to attribute propositional attitudes to others develops. In the present article we will propose that humans’ mind-reading abilities rely on the capacity to adopt a simulation routine. This capacity might have evolved from an action execution/observation matching system whose neural correlate is represented by a class of neurons recently discovered in the macaque monkey premotor cortex: mirror neurons (MNs).
The macaque monkey premotor area F5 and mirror neurons Converging anatomical evidence (see Matelli and Luppino1 for review) supports the notion that the ventral premotor cortex (referred to also as inferior area 6) is composed of two distinct areas, designated as F4 and F5 (Ref. 2) (Fig. 1A).
Area F5 occupies the most rostral part of inferior area 6, extending rostrally within the posterior bank of the inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus. Area F5 is reciprocally connected with the hand field of the primary motor cortex3–5 and has direct, although limited, projections to the upper cervical segments of the spinal cord6 . Microstimulation in F5 evokes hand and mouth movements at thresholds generally higher than in the primary motor cortex7,8. The functional properties of F5 neurons were assessed in a series of single unit recording experiments9–11. These experiments showed that the activity of F5 neurons is correlated with specific hand and mouth motor acts and not with the execution of individual movements like contractions of individual muscle groups.
What makes a movement into a motor act is the presence of a goal. This distinction is very important since it allows one to interpret the role of the motor system not just in terms of the control of the dynamic variables of movement (like joint torques, etc.), but rather as a possible candidate for the instantiation of mental states such as purpose or intention.
Using the effective motor act as the classification criterion, the following types of neurons were described: ‘Grasping neurons’, ‘Holding neurons’, ‘Tearing neurons’ and ‘Manipulation neurons’. Grasping neurons discharge when 493 Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading Vittorio Gallese and Alvin Goldman A new class of visuomotor neuron has been recently discovered in the monkey’s premotor cortex: mirror neurons. These neurons respond both when a particular action is performed by the recorded monkey and when the same action, performed by another individual, is observed. Mirror neurons appear to form a cortical system matching observation and execution of goal-related motor actions. Experimental evidence suggests that a similar matching system also exists in humans. What might be the functional role of this matching system? One possible function is to enable an organism to detect certain mental states of observed conspecifics. This function might be part of, or a precursor to, a more general mind-reading ability. Two different accounts of mindreading have been suggested. According to ‘theory theory’, mental states are represented as inferred posits of a naive theory. According to ‘simulation theory’, other people’s mental states are represented by adopting their perspective: by tracking or matching their states with resonant states of one’s own. The activity of mirror neurons, and the fact that observers undergo motor facilitation in the same muscular groups as those utilized by target agents, are findings that accord well with simulation theory but would not be predicted by theory theory.

In the upper and middle panels rasters and histograms are aligned (vertical bar) with the moment in which the experimenter grasps the food.

In the upper panel the recorded monkey observes another monkey grasping food. In the middle panel the recorded monkey observes the experimenter grasping food. In the lower panel the recorded monkey actively grasps food. Each panel illustrates five consecutive trials. The spontaneous activity of the neuron was virtually absent. (Panels B and C are modified from Ref. 15.) the monkey performs movements aimed to take possession of objects with the hand (‘Grasping-with-the-hand neurons’), with the mouth (‘Grasping-with-the-mouth neurons’), or with both. Grasping-with-the-hand neurons form the largest class of F5 neurons. Most neurons of this class are selective for different types of grip. The role of these neurons has been conceptualized by Rizzolatti12 as a ‘motor vocabulary’ of actions related to prehension.
The study of F5 neurons’ responsiveness to visual stimuli led to the discovery of two distinct classes of neurons: canonical neurons13, which are activated during observation of graspable objects, and MNs (see Refs 14,15) which discharge when the monkey observes another individual performing an action. We will describe in more detail the functional properties of this class of neurons. Figure 1B and C illustrate two examples of the activity of MNs.
MNs respond both when a particular action is performed by the recorded monkey and when the same action performed by another individual is observed. All MNs, as mentioned above, discharge during specific goal-related motor acts. Grasping, manipulating and holding objects are by far the most effective actions triggering their motor response. About half of them discharge during a specific type of prehension, precision grip (prehension of small objects by opposing the thumb and the index finger) being the most common one. The most effective visual stimuli triggering MNs’ visual responses are actions in which the experimenter (Fig. 1B), or a second monkey (Fig. 1C), interacts with objects with their hand or with their mouth.
Neither the sight of the object alone nor of the agent alone is effective in evoking the neuronal response. Mimicking the action without a target object, or performing the action by using tools (middle panel of Fig. 1B) is similarly ineffective. In over 90 percent of MNs a clear correlation between the most effective observed action and their motor response was observed. In many neurons this correlation was strict both in terms of the general goal of the action (e.g. grasping) and in terms of the way in which it was executed (e.g.
precision grip)14,15.
On the basis of their functional properties, here summarized, MNs appear to form a cortical system that matches observation and execution of motor actions. What could be the possible functional role of this matching system? Before addressing this issue it is important to stress that the existence of an equivalent system has also been demonstrated in humans.
The mirror system in humans Two lines of evidence strongly suggest that an action/observation matching system similar to that discovered in monkeys also exists in humans. The first refers to an elegant study by Fadiga et al.16 in which the excitability of the motor cortex of normal human subjects was tested by using Transcranic Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The basic assumption underlying this experiment was the following. If the observation of actions activates the premotor cortex in humans, as it does in monkeys, this mirror effect should elicit an enhancement of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by TMS of the motor cortex, given its strong anatomical links to premotor areas. TMS was performed during four different conditions: observation of an experimenter grasping objects; observation of an experimenter doing aimless movements in the air with his arm; observation of objects; detection of the dimming of a small spot of light. The results of this study showed that during grasping observation MEPs recorded from the hand muscles markedly increased with respect to the other conditions, including the attention-demanding dimming detection task.
Even more intriguing was the finding that the increase of excitability was present only in those muscles that subjects would use when actively performing the observed movements. This study provided for the first time evidence that humans have a mirror system similar to that in monkeys.
Every time we are looking at someone performing an action, the same motor circuits that are recruited when we ourselves perform that action are concurrently activated.
These results posed the question of the anatomical location of the mirror system within the human brain. This issue has been addressed by two brain-imaging experiments utilizing the technique of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (Refs 17,18). These two experiments, although different in many respects, shared a condition in which normal human subjects observed the experimenter grasping 3-D objects. Both studies used the observation of objects as a control condition. The results showed that grasping observation significantly activates the cortex of the left superior temporal sulcus (Brodmann’s area 21), of the left inferior parietal lobule (Brodmann’s area 40) and of the anterior part of Broca’s region (Brodmann’s area 45). The activation, during action observation, of a cortical sector of the human brain traditionally linked with language raises the problem of the possible homologies between Broca’s region and the premotor area F5 of the monkey, in which MNs have been discovered. This issue is outside the scope of the present article and will not be dealt with here (for discussion, see Ref. 19).
Mirror neurons and mind-reading What is the function of the mirror system? One possible function could be to promote learning by imitation. When new motor skills are learned, one often spends the first training phases trying to replicate the movements of an observed instructor. MNs could in principle facilitate that kind of learning. We do not favor this possible role of MNs, at least in non-human primates (see Box 1). Here we explore another possibility: that MNs underlie the process of ‘mind-reading’, or serve as precursors to such a process.
Mind-reading is the activity of representing specific mental states of others, for example, their perceptions, goals, beliefs, expectations, and the like. It is now agreed that all normal humans develop the capacity to represent mental states in others, a system of representation often called folk psychology. Whether non-human primates also deploy folk psychology is more controversial (see last section of this article), but it certainly has not been precluded. The hypothesis explored here is that MNs are part of – albeit perhaps a rudimentary part of – the folk psychologizing mechanism.
Like imitation learning, mind-reading could make a contribution to inclusive fitness. Detecting another agent’s Gallese and Goldman – Mirror neurons and mind-reading 495 Trends in Cognitive Sciences – Vol. 2, No. 12, December 1998 Opinion goals and/or inner states can be useful to an observer because it helps him anticipate the agent’s future actions, which might be cooperative, non-cooperative, or even threatening. Accurate understanding and anticipation enable the observer to adjust his responses appropriately. Our discussion of mind-reading will initially and primarily focus on humans; later we will return to its possible realization in non-human primates.
Two theories of mind-reading There is a large literature concerned with the nature of (human) mind-reading. Two types of approaches have dominated recent discussion: theory theory (TT) and simulation theory (ST) (Refs 20–22). The fundamental idea of TT is that ordinary people accomplish mind-reading by acquiring and deploying a commonsense theory of the mind, something akin to a scientific theory. Mental states attributed to other people are conceived of as unobservable, theoretical posits, invoked to explain and predict behavior in the same fashion that physicists appeal to electrons and quarks to predict and explain observable phenomena. On the standard presentation, the theory of mind possessed by ordinary people consists of a set of causal/explanatory laws that relate external stimuli to certain inner states (e.g. perceptions), certain inner states (e.g. desires and beliefs) to other inner states (e.g. decisions), and certain inner states (e.g. decisions) to behavior. This picture has been articulated by functionalist philosophers of mind23–26 as well as by developmental psychologists27,28. According to TT, attributing particular mental states to others arises from theoretical reasoning involving tacitly known causal laws.
Much on this subject has been done by developmentalists, eager to determine how the mind-reading capacity is acquired in childhood29. Many interpret children’s changes in mind-reading skills as evidence in favor of TT because the skill changes are construed as manifestations of changes in theory30,31. Theory theorists differ among themselves as to whether theory of mind is acquired by a general-purpose scientizing algorithm32 or by the maturation of a domainspecific module or set of modules33,34. This debate will not concern us here.
ST arose partly from doubts about whether folk psychologizers really represent, even tacitly, the sorts of causal/explanatory laws that TT typically posits. ST suggests that attributors use their own mental mechanisms to calculate and predict the mental processes of others. For example, Kahneman and Tversky35 gave subjects a description of two travellers who shared the same limousine en route to the airport and were caught in a traffic jam. Their planes were scheduled to depart at the same time, but they arrived 30 minutes late. Mr A was told that his flight left on time; Mr B was told that his flight was delayed and just left five minutes ago. Who was more upset? Ninety-six percent of the experimental subjects said that Mr B was more upset.
How did they arrive at this answer? According to TT there must be some psychological law they exploited to infer the travellers’ relative upsetness. According to ST, on the other hand, each subject would have put himself in each of the imaginary traveller’s ‘shoes’ and imagined how he would have felt in their place36. Another example concerns the prediction of decisions. To predict White’s next move in a chess match ST suggests that you try to simulate White’s thought processes and arrive at a decision which you then attribute to him36–38. First you create in yourself pretend desires, preferences, and beliefs of the sort you take White to have; for example, preferences among chess strategies.
These pretend preferences and beliefs are fed into your own decision-making mechanism, which outputs a (pretend) decision (see Fig. 2). Instead of acting on that decision, it is taken ‘off-line’ and used to predict White’s decision.
Opinion Gallese and Goldman – Mirror neurons and mind-reading 496 Trends in Cognitive Sciences – Vol. 2, No. 12, December 1998 The ability of non-human primates to imitate the behavior of conspecifics is a highly controversial issue. Tomasello et al.a identify three strict criteria to delimit imitational learning: (1) the imitated behavior should be novel for the imitator; (2) it should reproduce the behavioral strategies of the model; (3) it should share with it the same final goal. Behaviors not satisfying these criteria should not be considered as true imitational ones, and are rather to be explained by means of other mechanisms such as stimulus enhancement, emulation, or response facilitation. By applying these strict criteria to the extant literature, Tomasello et al.a exclude the possibility that wild animals may display true imitative behavior. A different perspective is offered by Byrne and Russonb . These authors start from the concept that behaviors display a hierarchical structure, and can be therefore described at several levels of increasing complexity. Manual skills represents a good example. Because complex behaviors are hierarchically structured, ‘…there exists a range of possibilities for how imitation might take place, beyond the simple dichotomy of imitation versus no imitation’.
Byrne and Russonb single out an action-level imitation in which a detailed specification of the various motor sequences composing a complex action is made, and a program-level imitation in which the broader, more highly structured component of a complex skill is retained, with subjective solutions to the low-level specifications. Byrne and Russonb conclude that imitational learning in non-human primates might have been overlooked by the exclusive application of the action-level strategy as the defining criterion.
What is the relevance of MNs for imitation in non-human primates? First of all, it should be stressed that imitation behavior has never been observed in association with MN activity.
Furthermore, even adopting Byrne and Russon’s criteria, we are not aware of any clearcut evidence of imitation of grasping behavior among adult macaque monkeys, although this possibility is not precluded for young monkeys during development. On the basis of these considerations we are inclined not to favor the hypothesis that MNs in area F5 promote grasping imitation learning in adult monkeys.

Brain Sci. (in press) Box 1. Mirror neurons and imitation According to this simulation account, you need not know or utilize any psychological laws.
If simulation is going to make accurate predictions of targets’ decisions, pretend desires and beliefs must be sufficiently similar to genuine desires and beliefs that the decision-making system operates on them the same way as it operates on genuine desires and beliefs. Are pretend states really similar enough to the genuine articles that this will happen?
Homologies between pretend and natural (i.e. non-pretend) mental states are well documented in the domains of visual and motor imagery39–43. (We assume here that visual and motor imaging consist, respectively, in pretending to see and pretending to do; see Currie and Ravenscroft44.) These visual and motor homologies do not show, of course, that other pretend mental states, for example, desires and beliefs, also functionally resemble their natural counterparts, but informal evidence suggests this (see Goldman45).
The difference between TT and ST The core difference between TT and ST, in our view, is that TT depicts mindreading as a thoroughly ‘detached’ theoretical activity, whereas ST depicts mindreading as incorporating an attempt to replicate, mimic, or impersonate the mental life of the target agent46. This difference can be highlighted diagrammatically, as shown in Fig. 3.
In the simulation scenario there is a distinctive matching or ‘correspondence’ between the mental activity of the simulator and the target. This is highlighted by the similar state-sequences the two undergo (Fig. 3, A and B), the only exception being that the simulator uses pretend states rather than natural states. The attributor in the TT scenario (Fig.
3C) does not utilize any pretend states that mimic those of the target; nor does he utilize his own decision-making system to arrive at a prediction. Thus, ST hypothesizes that a significant portion of mind-reading episodes involves the process of mimicking (or trying to mimic) the mental activity of the target agent. TT predicts no such mimicking as part of the mind-reading process. This contrast presents a potential basis for empirically discriminating between ST and TT. If there is evidence of mental mimicry in the mindreading process, that would comport nicely with ST and would not be predicted by TT.
Before turning to such evidence, however, we should note that simulation can be used to retrodict as well as predict mental states, that is, to determine what mental states of a target have already occurred. Figure 4 depicts a retrodictive use of simulation. The attributor starts with the question, ‘What goal did the target have that led him to perform action m?’ He conjectures that it was goal g, and tries out this conjecture by pretending to have g as well as certain beliefs about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the action m vis-à-vis goal g. This simulation leads him to form a (pretend) decision to do m. He therefore uses this result to conclude that the target did indeed have goal g. In this fashion, the attributor ultimately makes a ‘backward’ inference from the observed action to a hypothesized goal state.
Mirror neurons and simulation In a similar fashion, it is conceivable that externally-generated MN activity serves the purpose of ‘retrodicting’ the target’s mental state, moving backwards from the observed action. Let us interpret internally generated activation in MNs as constituting a plan to execute a certain action, for example, the action of holding a certain object, grasping it, or manipulating it. When the same MNs are externally activated – by observing a target agent execute the same action – MN activation still constitutes a plan to execute this action. But in the latter case the subject of the MN activity knows (visually) that the observed target is concurrently performing this very action. So we assume that he ‘tags’ the plan in question as belonging to that target. In fact, externally generated MN activity does not normally produce motor execution of the plan in question. Externally generated plans are largely inhibited, or taken ‘off-line’, precisely as ST postulates. Thus MN activity seems to be nature’s way of getting the observer into the same ‘mental shoes’ as Gallese and Goldman – Mirror neurons and mind-reading 497 Trends in Cognitive Sciences – Vol. 2, No. 12, December 1998 Opinion Perceptual processes Inference mechanisms Beliefs Desires Decision-making (practical reasoning) system Behavior-predicting and -explaining system ‘Pretend’ belief and desire generator Body monitoring system Action control system Behavior Fig. 2 The basic elements of the simulation routine. Cognitive steps in predicting or explaining someone’s decision by means of simulation are shown in the lower part of the figure. A dedicated pretend-state generator generates pretend beliefs and desires suited to the target agent. These pretend beliefs and desires are fed into the attributor’s decision-making system (the same system that normally operates on natural, non-pretend beliefs and desires). The output of the decision-making system is taken ‘off-line’. That is, instead of being fed into the action control system, the output decision is sent to the behavior-predicting and -explaining system, which outputs a prediction that the target will make that very decision. (Modified from Ref. 59.) the target – exactly what the conjectured simulation heuristic aims to do.
Although we compare externally generated MN activity with what transpires in Fig. 4, there clearly are differences.
One difference is that the real attributor does not go back to a distal goal or set of beliefs. He only goes back to a motoric plan. Still, this seems to be a ‘primitive’ use of simulation with the same structure as that depicted in Fig. 4. It also bears a resemblance to the motor theory of speech perception advocated by Liberman47, in which the common link between the sender and the receiver is not sound but the neural mechanism, shared by both, allowing the production of phonetic gestures.
A proponent of TT might say that TT also has ways of accounting for retrodictive attributions of mental states. Is it clear that anything similar to simulation occurs in externally generated MN activity? The point is that MN activity is not mere theoretical inference. It creates in the observer a state that matches that of the target. This is how it resembles the simulation heuristic. Nothing about TT leads us to expect this kind of matching.
It should be emphasized that the hypothesis being advanced here is not that MNs themselves constitute a full-scale realization of the simulation heuristic. In particular, we do not make this conjecture for MNs in monkeys. Our conjecture is only that MNs represent a primitive version, or possibly a precursor in phylogeny, of a simulation heuristic that might underlie mind-reading.
A further link between mirror neuron activity and simulation can be inferred from the fact that, as the TMS experiment by Fadiga et al.16 demonstrates, the human equivalent matching system facilitates in the observer the same muscle groups as those utilized by the target. This supports the idea that even when one is observing the action of another, one undergoes a neural event that is qualitatively the same as an event that triggers actual movement in the observed agent. It is as if the tracking process in the observer is not taken entirely off-line. This might appear to be a violation of ST, but actually it is wholly within ST’s spirit. ST postulates mental occurrences in the mind-reader that are analogous to mental occurrences in the target, so it is not surprising that downstream motor activity is not entirely inhibited. If TT were correct, and an observer represents a target’s behavior in purely theoretical fashion, it would not be predicted that the same muscle groups would be facilitated in the observer as in the target. But if ST were correct, and a mind-reader represents an actor’s behavior by recreating in himself the plans or movement intentions of the actor, then it is reasonable to predict that the same muscular activation will occur in the mind-reader. As matching muscular activation is actually observed in the observer, this lends support to ST as opposed to TT.
Clinical evidence of a similar phenomenon is found in so-called ‘imitation behavior’48. A group of patients with Opinion Gallese and Goldman – Mirror neurons and mind-reading 498 Trends in Cognitive Sciences – Vol. 2, No. 12, December 1998 Theoretical reasoning system T will decide to do m T desires g Decision-making law T believes (m g) C Decision making system T will decide to do m m g m g T T B T Decision making system m g m g A Fig. 3 Two possible ways of predicting someone’s decision.

(B) shows how an attributor can successfully predict this agent’s decision using a simulation routine. After learning of the target’s (T) desire and belief (for example, from previous applications of the simulation routine), the attributor creates similar pretend states in himself. These states are ‘tagged’ as belonging to the target, and then fed into the attributor’s decision-making system, which outputs a (pretend) decision to do m. The attributor takes this decision ‘off-line’ and predicts that the target will decide to do m. (C) represents the way an attributor might predict the target’s decision using theoretical reasoning. The attributor starts with knowledge that the target has a desire for goal g and a belief that m would achieve g. He also believes some psychological law about human decision-making. These beliefs are all fed into his own theoretical-reasoning system, which outputs the belief that the target will decide to do m. Squares represent desires; ellipses represent beliefs; diamonds represent decisions; and hexagons represent cognitive mechanisms. Shading indicates that the mental state is a pretend state.

prefrontal lesions compulsively imitate gestures or even complex actions performed in front of them by an experimenter. This behavior is explained as an impairment of the inhibitory control normally governing motor schemas, or plans. It may be inferred from this that normal humans, when observing someone else perform an action, generate a plan to do the same action, or an image of doing it, themselves. Normally this plan is inhibited so that it does not yield motor output, but such inhibition is impaired in the patient population in question48.
Non-human primates: behaviorists or mind-readers?
A mind-reading capacity for non-human primates is a hotly debated issue among primatologists and behavioral scientists.
In a recent paper Heyes49 argued that a survey of empirical studies of imitation, self-recognition, social relationships, deception, role-taking and perspective-taking fails to support the theory of mind hypothesis over non-mentalist alternatives. Although, for sake of concision, it is not possible here to address this issue thoroughly (for reviews see Refs 49 and 50), a few points are worth making.
Let us consider first the social nature of non-human primates. Social organization is by no means a distinctive feature of primates: within the realm of insects several species (ants are one example) are endowed with a clear social structure. The distinctive hallmark of the social organization of non-human primates is its sophisticated complexity. Nonhuman primates live in groups that can comprise as many as 100 individuals. These groups are characterized by intense and diversified types of social interactions51. Within such a complex and hierarchically organized social structure, individuals are able to recognize kinship, hierarchical ranks, to discriminate allies from enemies. Stammbach52 showed that dominant macaque monkeys modified their social relationships with lower-ranking individuals who had previously learned how to retrieve food by pressing a lever. Dominant individuals started grooming the low-ranking ones more often than before, once they ‘understood’ that the newly acquired skills of the low-ranking individuals could be more easily triggered, and therefore exploited, by using this sort of social upgrading. All these examples, although not providing conclusive evidence of mind-reading abilities, nevertheless, in our view, provide a strong argument supporting the hypothesis that non-human primates are endowed with cognitive abilities that cannot be easily dismissed as the result of simple stimulus–response operant conditioning.
Being a ‘cognizer’, nevertheless, does not necessarily imply being a mind-reader, or a possessor of the ability to detect intentional states in others. The argument that seems to suggest the presence, in non-human primates, of elementary forms of mind-reading abilities comes from the discovery of deceptive behavior. In a series of field experiments, Hauser53,54 showed that rhesus monkeys can withhold information about food location in order to deceive conspecifics and obtain more food for themselves. Deception is particularly relevant here, since deceptive behavior calls for the existence of second-order intentionality, and therefore for the capability to attribute mental states to conspecifics.
Gallese and Goldman – Mirror neurons and mind-reading 499 Trends in Cognitive Sciences – Vol. 2, No. 12, December 1998 Opinion Neurons responding to complex biological stimuli have been previously described in the macaque brain. A series of studies showed that in the inferior temporal cortex there are neurons that discharge selectively to the presentation of faces or handsa–c.
More recently it has been shown that some of these neurons respond to specific features of these stimulid . Neurons responding to complex biological visual stimuli such as walking or climbing were reported also in the amygdalae . Even more relevant to the issues addressed in the present paper is the work of Perrett and co-workersb,f,g. These authors showed that in the cortex buried within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) there are neurons selective to the observation of hand movements. These properties resemble the visual properties of F5 MNs very closely: both populations of neurons code the same types of actions; they both generalize their responses to the different instances of the same action; they both are not responsive to mimicked hand actions without the target object. However, the unique feature of F5 MNs resides in the fact that they also discharge during active movements of the observer. An observed action produces the same neural pattern of activation as does the action actively made by the observer.
The presence of two brain regions with neurons endowed with similar complex visual properties raises the question of their possible relationship. Two possibilities might be suggested.
One is that F5 MNs and STS neurons have different functional roles: STS neurons would code the semantic properties, the meaning, of hand–object interactions, while F5 MNs would be engaged in the pragmatic coding of the same actions. A second possibility, that we favor, is that these two ‘action detector’ systems could represent distinct stages of the same analysis. The STS neurons would provide an initial ‘pictorial’ description of actions that would be then fed (most likely through an intermediate step in the posterior parietal cortex) to the F5 motor vocabulary where it would acquire a meaning for the individual.
The latter hypothesis stresses the role of action in providing meaning to what is perceived.

Neural coding of complex biological stimuli The relevance of the data on deceptive behavior has been questioned on the basis of two main arguments. First, field reports of ethologists are anecdotal and therefore intrinsically ambiguous. Second, alternative non-mentalistic explanations, such as chance behavior, associative learning, and inferences about observable features of the situation have been proposed as more parsimonious explanations of deceptive behavior (see Heyes49).
However, according to Byrne55, who surveyed the literature thoroughly, there are at least 18 independent reports of intentional deception in non-human primates supporting the notion that they can represent the mental states of other conspecifics. On the basis of this evidence, Byrne and Whiten56 suggested that primates act according to a manipulative strategy very similar to that put forward in the sixteenth century by Niccolò Machiavelli in his masterpiece Il Principe57.
Our speculative suggestion is that a ‘cognitive continuity’ exists within the domain of intentional-state attribution from non-human primates to humans, and that MNs represent its neural correlate (see also Box 2). This continuity is grounded in the ability of both human and non-human primates to detect goals in the observed behavior of conspecifics. The capacity to understand action goals, already present in non-human primates, relies on a process that matches the observed behavior to the action plans of the observer. It is true, as pointed out by Meltzoff and Moore58, that the understanding of action goals does not imply a full grasp of mental states such as beliefs or desires. Action-goal understanding nevertheless constitutes a necessary phylogenetical stage within the evolutionary path leading to the fully developed mind-reading abilities of human beings.
The Simulating Social Mind: The Role of the Mirror Neuron System and Simulation in the Social and Communicative Deficits of Autism Spectrum Disorders Lindsay M. Oberman and Vilayanur S. Ramachandran University of California, San Diego The mechanism by which humans perceive others differs greatly from how humans perceive inanimate objects. Unlike inanimate objects, humans have the distinct property of being “like me” in the eyes of the observer. This allows us to use the same systems that process knowledge about self-performed actions, self-conceived thoughts, and self-experienced emotions to understand actions, thoughts, and emotions in others. The authors propose that internal simulation mechanisms, such as the mirror neuron system, are necessary for normal development of recognition, imitation, theory of mind, empathy, and language.
Additionally, the authors suggest that dysfunctional simulation mechanisms may underlie the social and communicative deficits seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorders.
Keywords: mirror neuron system, autism spectrum disorders, simulation, social impairments, communication impairments “When we see a stroke aimed, and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another person, we naturally shrink and draw back on our leg or our own arm . . . The mob, when they are gazing at a dancer on the slack rope, naturally writhe and twist and balance their own bodies, as they see him do.” —Adam Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments Over 200 years ago, Smith (1759) described the perception of others not simply in terms of simple observation but rather a result of active embodied understanding. Unlike inanimate objects, for which actions are processed visually and can be successfully predicted based on physical characteristics and physical laws, this type of processing—systemizing (Baron-Cohen, 2002)—is not sufficient for understanding human behaviors, because they are motivated by internal states that typically do not follow objectively predictable patterns. Thus, many researchers have proposed a simulation account of human perception (Barsalou, 1999; Gallagher & Meltzoff, 1996; Gallese, 2001; Gallese & Goldman, 1998). Though each researcher uses his or her own terminology, all generally claim that the understanding of human actions and internal states relies on both the capacity of the observer to perceive other humans as “like me” (Meltzoff & Moore, 1995) and the capacity to simulate the observed actions and internal states of other humans within the observer’s own motor, cognitive, and emotional representations.
This simulation account proposes that when typically developing individuals perceive another person in a certain situation, they will automatically and unconsciously project that perception back onto the observer’s own motor, cognitive, and emotional representations in order to run an offline simulation (Gallese, 2003).
This offline simulation, in turn, allows the observer to create an embodied understanding of the observed person’s behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. Thus, according to this view, it follows that the mechanisms by which we understand an action, thought, or emotion in another individual share an underlying neural circuitry with the mechanisms by which we execute such actions, thoughts, or emotions ourselves—what Gallese (2001) calls the “shared manifold of intersubjectivity” (p. 34) or “Intentional Attunement” (Gallese, 2004). Similarly, in the theory of mind literature, the simulation theory proposes that the observer performs an internal simulation of the perceived actions and then uses knowledge of his or her own actions and intentions in such a situation to infer others’ mental states (Gordon, 1986; Heal, 1986). Finally, from the motor control literature, computational models describe cells called emulators. Emulators receive an efferent copy of the motor command and produce a simulation of the sensory signals that would be produced in the organism as a result of that same command (Ito, 1984). Emulators would theoretically aid in motor control, prediction of actions, and motor imagery (Grush, 2004).
Barsalou (1999) united the aforementioned simulation theories with his perceptual symbol systems (PSS) framework. The first tenet of this theory is that knowledge (or internal representations) regarding perceptions, actions, and introspective states are represented in the same systems in which they are experienced. According to PSS, neurons, called conjunctive neurons, receive efferent copies of the input signal from all of the senses (including Lindsay M.

Once these so-called conjunctive neurons are established, they can be activated by cognitive simulation in the absence of bottom-up input.
PSS also establishes two central constructs: simulators and simulations. Simulators are distributed networks of conjunctive neurons that activate in response to a specific category. They are responsible for integrating the modality-specific information and forming a supramodal representation of a concept. Once a simulator is established for a certain category it enables the individual to reenact its content in the form of simulations. Simulations can be used to draw inferences about a given concept or to internally represent it through memory, language, and thought.
The original framework was extended by Barsalou (2003) to provide a mechanism by which these simulated concepts are incorporated into specific contexts. In this system, situated conceptualizations are proposed to contain simulations of four basic components of a context: people and objects, actions and body states, introspective states, and settings. According to PSS, each component of the conceptualization is simulated in the respective brain areas that originally encoded the information. Just as the simulators for a concept integrate the activity of the conjunctive neurons to formulate supramodal representations of that concept, the simulators for each component combine to form a supramodal simulation of the situation. Barsalou proposed that this simulation, which incorporates multiple core components of a context, allows the conceptualizer to have the experience of being in the situation.
Barsalou’s PSS framework brings together all of the simulation literature across the multiple domains and provides a unified theory for how humans interpret and interact with their environment.
Though the simulation account has a long history (dating back to at least 1759) and is intuitively appealing, debate continues over the theory’s validity in multiple domains. Additionally, it is unclear whether the underlying neural circuitry that mediates the simulation processes for perception, social interaction, and communication is centered in the motor system or whether multiple brain regions are capable of simulation. Recent research, which spans psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, and neuroscience, has begun to answer some of these questions. These answers also give hope for finding a possible neural basis for many of the behavioral deficits seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD; including autism, Asperger’s syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified).
In this review, we argue that when simulation processes are deficient, one is left with an individual with qualitative impairments in social interaction and communication skills, two of the three defining characteristics of ASD. Though rule-based knowledge clearly may influence how people perceive and interpret their environment, it cannot be sufficient, as evidenced by the deficits in ASD. Individuals with ASD have no difficulty understanding rule-based accounts of the environment (Baron-Cohen, 2002). In fact, high-functioning individuals with ASD often have superior systemizing ability (Baron-Cohen, Richler, Bisarya, Gurunathan, & Wheelwright, 2003).
Although researchers note that individuals with ASD have a clear impairment in understanding and interacting with other individuals, the underlying mechanisms that may mediate the spectrum of deficits in the areas of perception, social interaction, language, and behavior have remained a mystery. Historically, theories have focused on either (a) behavioral accounts (e.g., Baron-Cohen, 1995; Frith, 2001) in which one behavioral deficit is explained in terms of other behavioral deficits or (b) neuroanatomical accounts that implicate individual regions in the brain such as the amygdala or cerebellum (e.g., Baron-Cohen et al., 2000; Courchesne, 1997). These theories have had enormous hueristic appeal and must be considered in future theories, but one limitation of strictly behavioral and strictly neuroanatomical accounts is that neither explains the underlying functional mechanisms that mediate the deficits.
The most informative theories are those that are able to link neuroanatomy and functional mechanisms to the behavioral impairments that are unique to ASD. One theory, which does exactly this, suggests that a dysfunction in a specific functional system, the mirror neuron system (MNS), underlies the behavioral impairments in ASD (Altschuler et al., 2000; Williams, Whiten, Suddendorf, & Perrett, 2001). Our group has provided preliminary evidence for this theory on the basis of both a case study (Altschuler et al., 2000) and a follow-up study including 10 individuals with ASD (Oberman et al., 2005). Though we believe this theory is on the right track, there is no reason to believe that the MNSs in premotor and parietal cortices are the only systems in the human brain that have mirror or simulation properties. In this review, we propose a more comprehensive explanation implicating a deficit in simulation. As this review shows, there are multiple brain regions (including those that have been implicated in anatomical accounts of ASD) that appear to have simulation properties. Thus, the simulation system, similar to the immune system may be functionally modular but localized in multiple brain regions rather than a single region—a similar theory to the intentional attunement theory proposed by Gallese (2006).
This review discusses behavioral, neurophysiological, neuromagnetic, and neuroimaging findings that independently and collectively support the simulation view of perception, theory of mind, empathy, and language, all of which are essential skills for understanding and interacting with the environment in which we live and are core deficits in ASD. Though other views can account for some of these findings, our goal is not to provide a complete review of each of the alternative accounts but rather to stress that in all cases, the simulation view accounts for the data in the most parsimonious manner.
Perception and Imitation of Actions Evidence for the Role of Simulation in Typically Developing Individuals Though anecdotal references to simulation have been recorded as early as 1759, this view was made popular by philosophers including William James and Rudolph Hermann Lotze in the late 1800s, as evidenced by the following quotations: The spectator accompanies the throwing of a billiard ball, or the thrust of a swordsman, with slight movements of his arm; the untaught narrator tells his story with many gesticulations; the reader, while absorbed in the perusal of a battle scene, feels a slight tension run through his muscular system, keeping time as it were with the actions he is reading of. (Lotze, 1852; as quoted in James, 1890, p. 525) ROLE OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM IN ASD 311 An educated man . . . on entering his house one day he received a shock from crushing the finger of one of his little children in the door.
At the moment of his fright he felt a violent pain in the corresponding finger of his own body, and this pain abode with him three days.
(James, 1890, p. 712) Behavioral studies as early as those performed by Darwin indicate that when individuals are in the presence of others, the observer tends to synchronize his or her movements to match those of the others (Condon & Ogston, 1967; Darwin, 1872/1965; Kendon, 1970). More specifically, people tend to mimic others’ gestures and body postures (Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), facial expressions (Dimberg, 1982; Dimberg et al., 2000; Wallbott, 1991), tone of voice and pronunciation patterns (Goldinger, 1998; Neumann & Strack, 2000), as well as breathing rates (McFarland, 2001; Paccalin & Jeannerod, 2000).
It has been proposed that the increased likelihood of one performing a certain behavior when observing the same behavior in another individual is a result of automatic stimulus–response relationships, similar to priming in which the presence of the stimulus increases the probability of a response. Along these lines, James (1890) stated that “every representation of a movement awakens in some degree the actual movement which is its object” (p. 526). Another view suggests that the tendency toward mimicry can be accounted for by contagion similar to contagious yawns or laughter (Hatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1994; Laird et al., 1994).
Neither of these accounts necessarily suggests that observation and execution of actions share a common mechanism, as required by strict simulation theories. Other recent behavioral studies, however, have provided evidence that in addition to action observation influencing the occurrence of concurrent execution of that same action, the performance of an action influences the concurrent perception of that action. A simple stimulus–response relationship or contagion accounts have less explanatory power in this case.
The finding that action execution and action observation reciprocally modulate each other is taken as evidence for the simulation account of mimicry—that is, behavioral mimicry occurs because action observation and action execution are mediated by overlapping neural mechanisms.
One piece of evidence for a shared action observation– execution representation is found in a study conducted by Pietromonaco, Zajonc, and Bargh (1981). In this study, participants were asked to remember a set of 78 predominantly neutral faces (taken from a yearbook) while the participants either imitated the head and facial configuration, made simple judgments about the stimuli, squeezed a sponge, or chewed gum—a manipulation designed to prevent imitation. Results indicated that participants asked to imitate the faces performed the best at the later memory test (73% correct), whereas those who squeezed a sponge were at 65%, those asked to make judgments were 64% correct, and those who chewed gum (and thus were not able to imitate) were 59% correct. Unfortunately, this study leaves many questions unclear.
First, the study dealt with delayed memory of the expressions, so it is impossible to determine whether mimicry aided the initial perception of the stimuli or the encoding of the stimuli into memory, rehearsal, or retrieval. Second, it is possible that differences in task motivation or attention could account for the differences in memory between the three conditions. Still, despite these interpretational and empirical ambiguities, this pioneering empirical work continued to inspire research on the role of somatic feedback in perception.
Reed and Farah (1995) also investigated the influence of motor action on perception. They, however, used arm and leg actions rather than facial expressions. Reed and Farah’s studies showed significant improvements in recognition of other’s actions when the observer moved the same limb. In other words, if the observer was moving his own arm, he was more likely to recognize that the confederate moved her arm than her leg. This finding held up even when selective attention and conscious mimicry were controlled.
Reed and Farah concluded that the participants used the same body schema to process both their own and others’ movements. The same conclusion was also drawn by Ramachandran and RogersRamachandran (1996) when studying patients with anosognosia that was due to damage to the right parietal and frontal cortices.
These patients denied not only their own paralysis but also the paralysis of another individual. The authors concluded that damage to an individual’s own body schema may lead to deficits in making judgments about another individual’s actions, possibly as a result of damage to a specific system of neurons, namely the MNS, which is discussed later in this review.
Taken together, these behavioral studies support the conjecture that there is considerable overlap between the neural mechanism for action observation and action execution. However, behavioral studies are not able to speak to how this shared representation aids in recognition. This task has been undertaken by researchers in computational neuroscience who have developed models of neural networks that account for the role of simulation, or what they call emulators in the motor system.
An emulator is defined as “a device that mimics the input/output operation of a target system” (such as the motor system; Grush, 2004, p. 387). Grush (2004) suggested that an emulator is beneficial in many ways. First, it allows an individual to control his or her actions online and inhibit inaccurate or inappropriate actions prior to their occurrence. More important for this review, however, is its role in perception. Grush proposed that perception is a result of activation in an emulatory loop that receives input and mimics both the input from the senses and feedback from the observer’s own outputs, thus creating a mechanism that unites perception of the outside world and knowledge of the internal state of the observer.
These so-called emulators have been proposed to exist in the dentate of the cerebellum, according to behavioral, lesion, and neurophysiological studies (Grush, 2004; Ito, 1984; Wolpert, Zoubin, & Flanagan, 2001; see Decety, 1996, for a review). However, the question still remains whether the cerebellum emulators are unique or whether they are a part of a larger network of neural systems that serve to simulate their content. Neurophysiological and imaging studies conducted over the past 50 years appear to support the latter—that is, that multiple regions of the brain are capable of offline simulation.
Electroencephalography (EEG) studies from as early as 1954 demonstrated neural activity in the region of sensorimotor cortex when nonmoving subjects watched other individuals performing specific actions. While studying the changes in brain activity, French researchers Gastaut and Bert (1954) recorded EEG activity while subjects performed actions as well as while they were presented with visual stimuli. Though recordings were taken across the scalp at various frequency ranges, of particular interest 312 OBERMAN AND RAMACHANDRAN to this review are the electrical changes recorded over the rolandic (sensorimotor) region. Gastaut (1951) had previously reported that oscillations recorded over this region, in a frequency close to the alpha frequency (7–11 Hz), were reduced in amplitude when subjects performed a directed action or simply shifted their posture.
Just 3 years later, Gastaut and Bert (1954) found that the so-called rolandic arceau rhythm (named for its characteristic arc shape) was also reduced when subjects identified themselves with an active person represented on a screen, for example, when they viewed a film of a boxing match. Gastaut and Bert concluded that “the relation between the blocking of the ‘arceau’ rhythm and the image of boxers in action is unquestionable.” It is currently thought that suppression of this rhythm represents increased activity in the neural networks located in the rolandic region (Andrew & Pfurtscheller, 1997). Thus, as early as 1954, there was neurological evidence that the observation of actions in others activates neural systems in the observers’ sensorimotor systems, evidence for the role of simulation in visual perception.
Over 40 years later, Altschuler, Vankov, Wang, Ramachandran, and Pineda (1997) corroborated Gastaut and Bert’s (1954) finding by showing a reduction in power of the arceau rhythm (now referred to in the standardized Greek naming system as the mu wave) during the execution, imagination, and observation of human action and suggested that the suppression of the mu wave could be used as an EEG index of mirror neuron activity. Cochin, Barthelemy, Lejeune, Roux, and Martineau (1998) replicated this finding, showing mu wave suppression during the observation of actions performed by humans. No such modulation was present when subjects watched object movements. In a follow-up study, Cochin, Barthelemy, and Martineau (1999) reported that the response in the mu wave when subjects observed another performing an action was not significantly different from the response when subjects performed the action themselves. The authors cited this as evidence that action observation and execution share the same neural network.
Subsequently, multiple laboratories have reported similar results, finding a reduction in the power in the mu wave over central leads during the observation of others’ actions, and have supported the link between mu wave suppression and mirror neuron activity (Babiloni et al., 2002; Muthukumaraswamy & Johnson, 2004a, 2004b; Pineda, Allison, Vankov, 2000). Additionally, over the past several years, other techniques have also been successful in identifying activity in the area of the sensorimotor cortex during action observation. Hari and colleagues (Avikainen, Forss, & Hari, 2002; Hari et al., 1998) have successfully used magnetoencephalography to measure the activity of the precentral gyrus following stimulation of the median nerve. Beta frequency rebound over sensorimotor cortex showed a significant reduction during both action execution and action observation. The readiness potential, an event-related potential (ERP) marker of motor preparation recorded over the central leads prior to movement onset, has also been shown to be modulated by observed actions (Kilner, Vargas, Duval, Blakemore, & Sirigu, 2004). Furthermore, when the nature and onset of action is predictable, the rise of the readiness potential precedes the observed movement’s onset. Kilner et al. (2004) proposed that this type of timing might allow the observer not only to react to others’ actions but also to anticipate actions that will be performed in the near future.
Though electrophysiological recordings from the scalp give us broad estimates of neural systems involved in certain behaviors, their spatial resolution is less than satisfactory for exact localization of neural mechanisms. The ideal technique for such research is to record directly from individual neurons in awake human volunteers, but such an opportunity is rarely available to researchers. Alternatively, animal studies on closely related species can be incredibly informative for such an investigation. The macaque monkey has been the prime subject for investigation of the mechanisms underlying action observation and execution.
The most relevant finding in macaque single-unit electrophysiology research was made by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues (Di Pellegrino, Fadiga, Fogassi, Gallese, & Rizzolatti, 1992; Fogassi, Gallese, Fadiga, & Rizzolatti, 1998; Gallese, Fogassi, Fadiga, & Rizzolatti, 2002). While studying the premotor cortex in the macaque, they came across a system of neurons in area F5 that responded not only when the monkey performed an action but also when the monkey watched the researcher perform a similar action (Di Pellegrino et al., 1992). The team named this system of neurons the mirror neuron system because it appeared that the observed action was mirrored or simulated within the monkey’s own motor system. In addition to the original mirror neurons found in the macaque’s premotor cortex, neurons in the inferior parietal lobule have also been found to have mirror properties (Fogassi et al., 1998; Gallese et al., 2002).
The discovery of the MNS gained immediate attention and raised two questions: Does a similar system exist in humans? And could this be the elusive neural mechanism subserving the action observation– execution link that enables humans to imitate?
Though few researchers referred to this system by name prior to the late 1990s, there was already a large body of behavioral, physiological, and lesion data (discussed earlier in this review) supporting the existence of the MNS in humans. However, these techniques gave little clue to the spatial location of such a system.
The first attempt to localize the human MNS was in a study conducted by Fadiga, Fogassi, Pavesi, and Rizzolati (1995). Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Fadiga et al. investigated whether the premotor cortex in humans responded when the participants watched others’ actions. It was determined, on the basis of anatomical cytoarchitecture, that the homologous region to the macaque F5 is human Brodmann’s area 44/45, also known as Broca’s area. Fadiga et al. found that TMS applied over Broca’s area resulted in greater motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) when the subject observed another person moving as compared with a baseline rest condition. Furthermore, the pattern of muscle activation evoked by TMS during action observation was very similar to the pattern of muscle contractions present during the execution of the same action.
Subsequent to this neuromagnetic study, positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (Decety et al., 1997; Iacoboni et al., 1999) showed selective activity in the frontal operculum (Brodmann’s area 44/ 45) and the anterior parietal cortex when subjects watched human actions. Further, this activity, similar to the macaque correlate, was somatotopically distributed in both premotor and parietal regions (Buccino et al., 2001).
Two additional regions of the human cortex that appear to have mirror properties have recently been discovered. The first, the superior temporal sulcus (STS), was originally identified for its ROLE OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM IN ASD 313 selective response to the observation of biological motion in monkeys (Oram & Perrett, 1994; Perrett, Harris, Mistlin, & Hietanen, 1990) and in humans (Bonda, Petrides, Ostry, & Evans, 1996; Puce, Allison, Bentin, Gore, & McCarthy, 1998). More recent studies have also indicated that this region has a somatotopic representation with the observation of hand actions activating inferior posterior regions, mouth actions activating mid posterior regions, and eye movements activating superior posterior regions (Pelphrey, Morris, & McCarthy, 2005). In addition to its visual properties, human STS also responds to the imitation of an action (Iacoboni et al., 2001). This activation is greater during imitation than during control motor tasks and continues to respond even when the subject’s view of his or her hand is obscured. The second region is the so-called extrastriate body area. The extrastriate body area was first classified by Downing, Jiang, Shuman, and Kanwisher (2001) on the basis of its response to the visual perception of human bodies and body parts. A recent study conducted by Astafiev, Stanley, Shulman, and Corbetta (2004) report fMRI activation in this region in response to the subject’s moving his or her own arm or leg toward a target in the absence of visual feedback. This activation was also present after attention and sensory properties of the target were controlled. Thus, it appears that multiple regions of the human brain may be capable of motor simulation (inferior frontal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal sulcus, extrastriate body area, and the dentate of the cerebellum).
The aforementioned findings provide strong evidence that an action observation– execution matching system, similar to that found in the macaque premotor and parietal cortices, albeit in a more extensive system, exists in the human brain. Since the original studies, specific properties of the human MNS have been investigated. Studies have reported that unlike the macaque system, human mirror neurons respond to goal-directed, non-goaldirected, and pantomimed actions (Buccino et al., 2001; Grezes, Armony, Rowe, & Passingham, 2003), whereas the monkey system responds only to goal-directed actions (Gallese, Fadiga, Fogassi, & Rizzolati, 1996).
Additionally, human mirror neurons are selective to actions within the observer’s motor repertoire. In other words, if the observer is unable to match the observed action to a motor representation within his or her own system, the mirror neurons will not respond (Buccino et al., 2004; Stevens, Fonlupt, Shiffrar, & Decety, 2000). The individual need not be familiar or skilled at the action but only physically capable of performing it. For example, actions such as grasping and biting, which humans share with other primates, will activate the human MNS whether the observed action is performed by a human or a macaque. However, observing a dog barking, which is not part of the human motor repertoire, does not activate this system but rather is processed in lower level perceptual systems (Buccino et al., 2004). Furthermore, actions that are part of the human motor repertoire but are not familiar will not activate the MNS as much as actions that are familiar to the observer. This property was demonstrated in a study conducted by Calvo-Merino, Glaser, Grezes, Passingham, and Haggard (2005), who recorded fMRI data from expert dancers and found increased activity to the observation of others performing familiar styles of dance movements, as compared with unfamiliar styles matched for low-level visuomotor properties.
Though it is hard to argue against the existence of a human MNS, its function has yet to be clearly delineated. In their original article, Di Pellegrino et al. (1992) proposed that the MNS may help an observer understand the actions of another by mapping them onto his or her own motor representations. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that when human subjects are instructed to observe actions with the intent to imitate (as opposed to remember), the MNS is selectively involved in the imitation condition (Decety et al., 1997). This finding has led researchers to add imitation to the list of functions of the MNS. Critics, however, are quick to point out that macaques and many other primates do not typically show imitation behaviors (Visalberghi & Fragaszy, 2001; Whiten & Ham, 1992) but do have mirror neurons. Thus, this system cannot be sufficient for the ability to imitate, but it may have been an evolutionarily necessary step that led to the ability to imitate in humans (Arbib, 2005; Ramachandran, 2000).
In a review article, Iacoboni (2005) outlined his theory of the neurological basis of imitation. He suggested that the circuit begins in the superior temporal cortex in which the visual properties of the observed action are coded. The signal is then sent to the posterior parietal cortex that provides somatosensory information regarding the observed action by means of the parietal mirror neurons.
Finally, the signal is sent to the frontal mirror neurons to code the goal of the action to be imitated. Before the action is ultimately sent to the primary motor cortex, however, an efferent copy of the motor command is sent back to the STS in order to match the predicted sensory consequences of the planned imitation to the visual description of the original observed action. If there is a good match, the action is initiated by the primary motor cortex. This series of connections has strong anatomical support from nonhuman primate studies (Jeannerod, Arbib, Rizzolatti, & Sakata, 1995; Rizzolatti, Luppino, & Matelli, 1998; Seltzer & Pandya, 1994; Taira, Mine, Georgopoulos, Murata, & Sakata, 1990).
A PET study (Grezes, Costes, & Decety, 1998) supported the activation of the dorsal visual stream extending up into premotor cortex while subjects watched meaningful actions with no instructions, as well as both meaningful and nonmeaningful actions with the intent to imitate at a later time point. Additionally, Ruby and Decety (2001) reported findings from a PET study finding that simulation of both self and other actions activate the inferior parietal cortex in the area of inferior parietal lobule where mirror neurons have been identified. Thus, although the MNS may not be sufficient to mediate imitation in the macaque, it is possible that, through evolution, the human MNS with the endowed ability to match action observation and action execution utilized this system for imitation.
The aforementioned data in both macaque single-unit physiology and human imaging provide convincing evidence that regions of the cerebral cortex primarily designated as part of the motor system are activated by the observation of others’ actions. Furthermore, this activity is thought to aid in visual recognition and imitation. Thanks to the discovery of the MNS, the simulation view of perception has gained new momentum and inspired collaboration between behavioral psychologists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists. One question that has yet to be answered, however, is whether the impairments in perception and imitation as seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorders are a result of dysfunction in these simulation systems.
314 OBERMAN AND RAMACHANDRAN Role of Simulation in the Perception and Imitation Deficits of ASD A multitude of studies performed over the past several decades (reviewed by Williams, Whiten, & Singh, 2004) have suggested that children with autism suffer from impairments in imitation. As imitation is thought to be a critical building block for early affective, social, and communicative development, an impairment in this domain can have quite deleterious consequences to a developing child (Rogers & Pennington, 1991). The first suggestions of an imitation deficit in ASD was made in 1953 (Ritvo & Provence, 1953) with an anecdotal report of a mother describing the inability of her 21-month-old to make pat-a-cake simply from watching her.
The only way the child could learn the game was to have the mother hold his hands and put them through the appropriate movements. Since this time, dozens of empirical studies have been published detailing the specific characteristics of the imitation deficits seen in ASD.
The first review of this literature was conducted by Rogers and Pennington (1991), who found strong evidence for the existence of an imitation deficit affecting simple body movements and actions with symbolic meaning. What became very apparent as more studies were conducted was that the imitation deficits in ASD varied on the basis of the specific task the child was asked to perform and the child’s age. For example, it has been suggested that the development of language might be necessary to derive benefit from the symbolic meaning of a gesture in an imitation task that includes meaningful gestures (Williams et al., 2004). Thus, older children and those with better language skills will perform better on imitation of symbolic gestures as compared with younger children or those with poor language skills (Green et al., 2002; Rogers, Bennetto, McEvoy, & Pennington, 1996). Second, imitation of actions with objects appears to be relatively less impaired compared with actions without objects in individuals with ASD (Aldridge, Stone, Sweeney, & Bower, 2000; Hammes & Langdell, 1981; Roeyers, Van Oost, & Bothuyne, 1998; Sigman & Ungerer, 1984). Finally, a common characteristic of the imitation deficit in individuals with ASD is reversal errors (that is, producing the movement with a 180° transformation). Reversal errors are also commonly seen in typically developing preschoolers (Ohta, 1987), suggesting that the imitative deficit in ASD may be characterized as a delay of normal development rather than an absolute deficit (Whiten & Brown, 1999).
Though recognized over 50 years ago (Ritvo & Provence, 1953) and studied in detail, the cause the imitation impairment has yet to be identified, though many theories exist, including Curcio’s (1978) symbolic representation hypothesis, Jones and Prior’s (1985) dyspraxia hypothesis, Rogers and Pennington’s (1991) self-other representation hypothesis, and Trevarthen and Aitken’s (2001) motivation hypothesis. The most recent review of the literature conducted by Williams et al. (2004) suggested that Rogers and Pennington’s hypothesis of a deficit in self-other mapping explains the findings from the empirical studies much better than the other proposed theories. Williams et al. suggested that typically developing individuals automatically and unconsciously use the same mechanism to process both self and other actions and use this mechanism for imitation, whereas Rogers and Pennington’s review (1991) suggested that infants with autism lack the ability to “form and coordinate social representations of self and other via amodal or cross-modal representation processes” (p. 137). They further suggested that this deficit in self– other mapping leads not only to their imitation impairments but also to their other social– communicative impairments.
If Williams et al. (2004) are correct, and the imitation deficits are not a result of impaired perception or impaired motor skills, but rather self– other mapping impairments underlie the imitation deficits, then it is plausible that the MNS, which appears to be involved in imitation in typically developing individuals, may also be the neurological basis of the imitation deficits in ASD. Five independent research groups have reported findings supporting this proposal. The first study to find evidence for MNS impairments in ASD was conducted by Altschuler et al. (2000), who recorded mu wave suppression in one child with autism. Preliminary results showed a lack of suppression to the observation of actions in others, suggesting a possible impairment in the MNS. In a follow-up study from the same laboratory, Oberman et al. (2005) corroborated this finding by demonstrating an absence of mu wave suppression in a sample of 10 individuals with ASD while they watched videos of another person’s actions. Although typically developing individuals showed significant mu-wave suppression, indicating normal MNS functioning, participants with ASD showed no significant change in mu power from a baseline condition.
Nishitani, Avikainen, and Hari (2004) also found evidence of an impairment in the MNS using magnetoencephalography. Subjects were presented with still pictures of a woman performing orofacial gestures and were instructed to imitate these gestures. Cortical activations were recorded from 8 adult subjects with Asperger’s syndrome and 10 control subjects. In both groups, activations were recorded over occipital cortex, superior temporal sulcus, inferior parietal lobe, inferior frontal lobe, and primary motor cortex.
Though the two group’s activations were similar for occipital cortex, superior temporal sulcus, and inferior parietal lobe, activations in inferior frontal lobe and primary motor cortex were weaker and had a greater latency in the Asperger’s syndrome group as compared with the control group. These findings suggest that the deficit is not in low-level visual processing, but rather in higher order cognitive processes in the prefrontal regions. Similarly, Villalobos, Mizuno, Dahl, Kemmotsu, and Muller (2005) found that area 44, the prefrontal mirror neuron area, had reduced functional connectivity with primary visual cortex in individuals with autism, as compared with matched controls. Both groups concluded that their findings provided evidence for impairment in the prefrontal MNS in individuals with ASD.
Another group (Theoret et al., 2005) recorded TMS-induced MEPs while subjects watched videos of finger movements that were directed either toward or away from the observer. In the control group, both types of actions resulted in increased MEPs recorded from the observer’s right first dorsal interosseus and abductor pollicis brevis muscles. The clinical group, consisting of individuals diagnosed with ASD, showed increased MEPs only to actions directed toward the observer (self-directed or allocentric) and no significant change from baseline in the away (other directed or egocentric) movement condition. The researchers explain this result in terms of a mirror neuron deficit leading to impairment in simulating egocentric actions and a general self– other representation deficit.
ROLE OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM IN ASD 315 Most recently, Dapretto et al. (2005) published a study in which they used fMRI to investigate activity in the MNS in individuals with ASD. Participants were asked to both imitate and observe emotional facial expressions while experimenters analyzed the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in regions thought to be part of the MNS. Whereas typically developing individuals showed activation in visual cortices, primary motor, premotor (including the inferior frontal gyrus, MNS region), limbic, and cerebellar regions, individuals with ASD did not show this pattern and, specifically, showed no significant activation of the inferior frontal gyrus. Additionally, the activity that was observed in the MNS regions in individuals with ASD was correlated with symptom severity, as indexed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 1989) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview (Lord, Rutter, & Le Couteur, 1994).
The aforementioned studies represent the developing body of literature supporting the role of an impaired premotor MNS in individuals with ASD. One of the first proposed, and most strongly supported, functions of the MNS is to support internal simulations of actions. Without the ability to internally simulate the visual perception of an action, motor imitation would likely be more difficult and performance would likely be abnormal. We would thus propose that the imitation deficits seen in individuals with ASD are best explained by their impairments in simulation caused by an impaired MNS.
Theory of Mind and Empathy From Imitation to Theory of Mind and Empathy in Typically Developing Individuals Arguably more socially relevant than understanding an action’s motor properties and being able to reproduce them (imitation) is the ability to understand the thoughts, intentions, and emotions that guide the observed action. Over the past 25 years, researchers in the areas of developmental psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy have devoted their careers to understanding how humans learn to attribute thoughts and intentions to others, referred to as theory of mind (TOM; Humphrey, 1976; Premack & Woodruff, 1978). Despite the over 25 years of research, there is still much debate over the underlying mechanism that leads to this ability. Thus, a vast literature has been developed by researchers proposing, testing, dissecting, and criticizing various theories. A thorough review of this literature, however, would be outside of the scope of this article. Thus, an overview of the two main competing theories is presented below (the reader is referred to Carruthers & Smith, 1996; Davies & Stone, 1995, for a balanced review of the debate).
The two major competing theories of the development of TOM are theory–theory and the simulation theory. The theory–theorists have suggested that individuals develop TOM over the first few years of life by testing given rules regarding the functions of the objects and organisms with which they interact as a child and eventually come up with a cognitive theory of what others are thinking (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997). Support for the theory– theories comes from behavioral studies finding that children appear to develop a theory of other minds at around age 3. Also, behavioral studies have found that 3-year-olds make errors about other’s knowledge that they do not make about their own knowledge. Finally, Saxe (2005) argued that when errors in others’ beliefs are made, the errors reflect knowledge of psychological laws governing how minds work.
Opposing theory–theories are simulation theories that propose that TOM is simply an outgrowth of the ability to interpret others’ actions through simulation. By creating an internal simulation, individuals can step into the mental shoes of another person and understand the thoughts, emotions, and intentions behind their behavior (see Gordon, 1986; Heal, 1986; Goldman, 2000, for reviews). In its strongest form, this view implies that understanding others’ minds requires no conceptual thinking or theory formation. Similar to the action simulation processes discussed earlier, the simulation theory simply requires that the observer reflect back on his or her own experience and use that knowledge to infer the mental state of the other individual. Simulation theories have been supported by brain-based studies that have found MNS activity in response to the goal or intention of an action and regions of the brain that respond both when subjects are asked to reflect on their own mental state and when they are asked to infer the mental state of another individual, which is discussed later in this section.
Although not traditionally discussed in reference to the simulation view of TOM, the “Mary” scenario provides an excellent example for the necessity of reflection on self-knowledge for the understanding of internal states of others. Jackson (1986) proposed a theoretical question of whether Mary, a color-blind neuroscientist who knows everything about the physiological processing of color but has never experienced it herself, would really know what it is to see red. Jackson proposed that the theory– experience gap would preclude Mary from understanding the internal qualia, or mental content, of the experience of seeing red. This theoretical scenario demonstrates the importance of an individual’s own experiences in the understanding of others’ mental states. Further, it suggests that simply having the cognitive theory of what others may think or feel in a certain scenario is not sufficient for TOM.
Similar to Mary, oftentimes individuals with autism can be taught rules regarding what individuals may think or how they may feel in a certain situation; however, they will often still have difficulty really knowing the other’s mental state.
Similar to the simulationist view of TOM, empathy by definition incorporates a simulation of an observed person’s internal state.
The term empathy was originally introduced by Theodore Lipps (1903) and used to describe the feeling one gets when watching an acrobat walking on a suspended wire. Lipps wrote, “I feel myself inside of him” (p. 121). This concept was further elaborated on by Edith Stein (1912/1964) in her book On the Problem of Empathy.
Stein proposed that empathy is not simply the understanding of other’s feelings or emotions in a cognitive or theoretical manner.
Rather, empathy is a function of one individual’s experiencing the same feelings as another individual through an appreciation of similarity. Most recently, Preston and de Waal (2002) proposed the perception–action model of empathy, which states that the attended perception of an individual’s state automatically activates the observer’s representations of the state and situation. Further, the activation of these representations automatically primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses unless inhibited.
Strong empirical evidence exists for the role of simulation in the ability to empathize with others’ emotions. When subjects are presented with stimuli of others displaying emotional facial ex316 OBERMAN AND RAMACHANDRAN pressions, typically developing individuals will automatically (without instruction to do so) mimic the facial expression of the stimuli (Bush, Barr, McHugo, & Lanzetta, 1989; Dimberg, 1982; Dimberg & Lundqvist, 1988). This mimicry occurs even when the stimuli are subliminally presented (Dimberg et al., 2000). This automatic facial mimicry response has been proposed to facilitate recognition and empathy for the observed emotion through a process of internal simulation of the corresponding facial expression (Lipps, 1907; Niedenthal, Brauer, Halberstadt, & Innes-Ker, 2001; Pietromonaco et al., 1981; Wallbott, 1991).
One study that provided evidence for the simulation account was conducted by Wallbott (1991). In this study, participants were videotaped while they performed an emotional facial recognition task. Each participant was then brought back to the laboratory for a subsequent session and asked to guess, on the basis of the videotape of his or her own face, what facial expression they were watching. The participants’ judgments of their own facial expressions were above chance, suggesting that the participants were imitating the facial expressions of the people they were judging.
Additionally, a correlation was found between the participants’ judgment of the stimuli and their judgment of their own (videotaped) facial expression. Finally, the recognition rate from the original study correlated with individuals’ recognition rate of their own (videotaped) facial expressions. Though the first two findings in this study do not discriminate between the emotional contagion and emotional recognition accounts, the correlation between the recognition score from the study and their self recognition score (when they were presented with only their own videotaped mimicry responses) is interpreted as evidence that the facial mimicry in fact aided in the recognition of the facial expressions in others.
Most recently, Niedenthal et al. (2001) provided direct evidence for the role of mimicry in recognition of facial expressions. Participants were asked to hold a pen sideways in their mouths, between their teeth and lips (preventing facial mimicry). Performance of the experimental group was compared against a group of participants that was free to move their faces naturally. Both groups were asked to identify a point at which a morphed face changed from happy to sad and vice versa. Participants who were prevented from using facial mimicry detected the change later in both directions than those who were able to move their face freely, indicating that the disruption of facial mimicry leads to impaired recognition of facial expression.
Although these studies support a relationship between automatic mimicry of facial expression and recognition, and theoretically, empathy has been conceived as a result of both external and internal mirroring (Lipps, 1903), a missing step exists in this theoretical account. If empathy is a result of internal and external mimicry, it would follow that individuals who are more empathetic should produce more facial mimicry than those who are less empathetic. In order to investigate this question, SonnbyBorgstrom, Jonsoon, and Svensson (2003) compared automatic facial mimicry in individuals who scored high and low on an emotional empathy scale (Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy). Highly empathetic individuals displayed electromyography (EMG) activity consistent with mimicry of the presented facial expressions at both automatic (56 ms) and controlled (2,350 ms) exposure levels. Low-empathetic individuals did not display mimicry at any exposure level. Thus, this study supports the role of simulation in emotional empathy.
If the simulation account of empathy and TOM is accurate and there is a link between motor and mental simulation, one would expect to see regions of the brain that respond to both the experience of a certain thought or emotion and the perception of that thought or emotion in another individual. One may also expect that the premotor MNS would not simply code the physical properties of actions but also be sensitive to the goals and intentions of those actions. Consistent with these claims, preliminary data suggest that mirror neurons in the premotor cortex may be sensitive to the goals and intentions of actions (Gallese et al., 1996; Iacoboni et al., 2005). fMRI studies have identified overlapping regions that respond to both the experience and perception of thoughts and emotions (Mitchell, Banaji, & Macrae, 2005; Morrison, Lloyd, DiPellegrino, & Roberts, 2004; Singer et al., 2004; Wicker et al., 2003). Finally, fMRI and lesion studies have indicated that sensorimotor cortices are not only involved but also necessary for normal performance on TOM and empathy tasks (Avenanti, Bueti, Galati, & Aglioti, 2005; Adolphs, Damasio, Tranel, Cooper, & Damasio, 2000).
In accordance with the simulation theory, single-unit studies with macaques have suggested that a proportion of mirror neurons are broadly congruent (Gallese et al., 1996), meaning they respond to the performance of an action and the observation of an action with a similar goal even if the exact physical properties of the action differs. Similarly, a recent fMRI study supported the claim that the human premotor MNS is sensitive to the intentions and goals of observed actions. In a recently published study, Iacoboni et al. (2005) showed participants videos of four different types of actions. The first video showed a person grasping objects in the absence of any context. The second video depicted scenes containing objects in a context with no actions. The third video showed someone grasping a cup with the intention to drink, and the fourth video showed the same action but in a different context that implied the intention to clean. Results suggested that the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the adjacent portion of the ventral premotor hand area (both within regions thought to be part of the human premotor MNS) were more active in the two intention conditions as compared with the other two nonintention videos. Additionally, the drinking intention condition resulted in significantly more activation than the cleaning intention videos.
These findings suggest that, like that of the monkey, the human premotor MNS is sensitive to the underlying intention that motivates perceived actions.
As would be expected from the facial mimicry research, fMRI conducted while people observe emotional facial expressions in others activates a similar network as imitation of those same expressions. Notable areas in this shared network include inferior frontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, insula, and amygdala, all of which not only showed increased activity in both observe and imitate conditions as compared with a rest condition but also showed more activity in the imitate condition as compared with the observe condition (Carr, Iacoboni, Dubeau, Mazziotta, & Lenzi, 2003). This study indicates that there is an overlapping region of premotor cortex that responds both when subjects are asked to interpret emotional facial expressions and when they observe hand actions.
Another brain region that may contain neurons with “mirror-like properties” for internal mental states is the medial prefrontal cortex, Brodmann’s Area 9. Though not traditionally thought of as ROLE OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM IN ASD 317 part of the MNS, this area responds both when subjects are asked to make judgments regarding their own abilities, personality traits, and attitudes (S. C. Johnson et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2002) and when they are asked to attribute intentions to characters in a comic strip (Brunet, Sarfati, Hardy-Bayle, & Decety, 2000) or infer another person’s knowledge about a familiar or unfamiliar object (Goel, Grafman, Sadato, & Hallett, 1995). In a recent study, subjects were asked to evaluate their own emotional responses to a picture and to infer the mental state of the individual in the picture (Ochsner et al., 2004). The medial prefrontal cortex responded during both conditions. Thus, it seems conceivable that the same region of the brain that is involved in representing the mental state of ourselves is also involved in inferring the mental states of others. Similar to the shared representation for the perception and performance of actions mediated by premotor mirror neurons, a system of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex may serve to create a mirror-like shared representation for the experience and perception of mental states. In this way, the medial prefrontal cortex may be the neural substrate that simulation theorists have been waiting for.
In three fMRI studies (Morrison et al., 2004; Singer et al., 2004; Wicker et al., 2003), empathy for specific emotions activated networks of cerebral cortex similar to the actual experience of that emotion. Both the experience of disgust (while inhaling foul smelling odorants) and the observation of others performing facial expressions of disgust activates the same regions of the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex (Wicker et al., 2003). Additionally, both the experience of a physically painful stimulus and the knowledge that a loved one is experiencing the same painful stimulus activates the anterior insula and rostral anterior cingulate cortex bilaterally (Singer et al., 2004). These areas were also correlated with individual empathy scores, indicating that the more an individual was able to use this shared network of cortices, the better his or her ability to empathize with others. Similarly, another study (Morrison et al., 2004) found that receiving a painful pin prick and watching a stranger receive the same pin-prick activated dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
Though the emotional aspects of pain are surely a large part of the pain matrix, the full experience of pain also contains sensory input, which has been shown to be important for empathy. In a study conducted by Avenanti et al. (2005), subjects watched actors being pricked by a sharp needle in either the hand or the foot.
MEPs were obtained from the same muscles in the observer while TMS was applied over the motor cortex. MEPs in the observer were reduced in the muscle that corresponded to the muscle that was pricked in the actor. The reduction in MEPs was also correlated with the observer’s subjective rating of the sensory aspects of the pain attributed to the actor and with sensory but not emotional, empathy measures. This finding suggests that modulation in activity in an observer’s motor cortex is related to their perception and ability to empathize with another individual’s pain, further supporting simulation theories.
These fMRI results provide evidence for the involvement of sensory cortices in emotion recognition but do not answer the question of whether this activity is necessary for normal recognition of emotion. One technique that begins to answer the question of necessity is lesion studies. These studies have identified paired deficits in the production and recognition of specific emotions.
Damage in the amygdala, for example, appears to impair both the expression and recognition of fear (Adolphs et al., 1999; Adolphs, Tranel, Damasio, & Damasio, 2002; Sprengelmeyer et al., 1999).
Similarly, damage in the insula and basal ganglia results in a paired impairment in the experience and recognition of disgust (Calder, Keane, Cole, Campbell, & Young, 2000). Finally, both the experience and recognition of anger appears to depend on the dopamine system, with a dopamine antagonist impairing both processes (Lawrence, Calder, McGowan, & Grasby, 2002).
Though these studies provide excellent support for the shared representation of experience and perception of emotions, the sample sizes were extremely low, resulting in limited statistical power and generalizability of the findings. This potential limitation was not a factor for Adolphs et al. (2000), however, who addressed the question of the necessity of sensorimotor cortices for recognition of emotions in visually presented facial expressions in 108 focal brain lesion patients and 30 healthy control participants. Subjects participated in three visual emotion recognition tasks. In the first task, participants were asked to rate the intensity of basic emotional facial expressions. In the second task, participants were asked to match a facial expression with the name of the emotion it is meant to convey. The final task required participants to sort facial expressions into emotional categories. Though each task identified a slightly different group of regions, damage to primary and secondary sensorimotor cortices impaired performance in all three tasks, supporting the critical role of sensory and motor cortices in the recognition of visually presented facial expressions.
Role of Simulation in the TOM and Empathy Deficits in ASD The aforementioned behavioral and neuroimaging studies offer strong evidence in support of the role of motor and sensory systems in social skills (such as TOM and empathy) in typically developing individuals. Additionally, as noted earlier in this review, an impaired motor system may play a critical role in the neural pathology of the imitative deficit in ASD. If the same system underlying motor simulation is a critical component in TOM and empathy (as suggested by Gallese, 2001) and if this system is in fact dysfunctional in individuals with ASD, then one would expect that these individuals would have both TOM and empathy deficits. Consistent with this argument, many researchers believe TOM and empathy deficits are central to the clinical manifestation of autism (see Baron-Cohen, 1995; Gillberg, 1992).
Anecdotally, Gillberg (1992) reported that children with autism are sensitive to affective change. In other words, individuals with autism can feel whether an interaction is full of strong emotion even if they do not show appropriate behavioral reactions to emotional events. It is possible, then, that these children can also feel emotions such as happiness, anger, and fear but that they have difficulty making sense of these feelings in others, leading to a behavioral impairment of empathy. This anecdotal report was subsequently supported with controlled studies showing individuals with ASD to have appropriate autonomic arousal (Blair, 1999; Shenk & Ramachandran, 2003) but impaired behavioral responses (Bacon, Fein, Morris, Waterhouse, & Allen, 1998; Corona, Dissanayake, Arbelle, Wellington, & Sigman, 1998; Sigman, Kasari, Kwon, & Yirmiya, 1992) to the observation of individuals in distress.
318 OBERMAN AND RAMACHANDRAN In addition to these behavioral studies, direct evidence for a facial mimicry deficit in individuals with ASD was seen in a recent study conducted by McIntosh, Reichmann-Decker, Winkielman, and Wilbarger (2006). In this study, adults with ASD, as well as age-, gender-, and verbal intelligence-matched typically developing individuals viewed pictures of happy and angry facial expressions. In one condition, automatic mimicry was measured by EMG when participants were instructed to “watch the pictures as they appear on the screen.” In a second condition, voluntary mimicry was measured by instructing the participants to “make an expression just like this one.” EMG electrodes placed over the cheek and brow recorded muscle activity. Despite displaying a normal pattern of voluntary mimicry, results from this study suggested that, unlike the participants in the matched control group, participants with ASD did not show automatic mimicry.
Similarly, TOM studies have found severe deficits in individuals with autism. In a series of studies conducted by Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith (1985, 1986), typically developing children, children with Down’s syndrome, and children with autism were given the “Sally-Anne” test. Whereas the vast majority of both 4-year-old typically developing children and mental age-matched children with Down’s syndrome passed the test, the majority of children, adolescents, and adults with autism failed, even when the task was controlled for verbal ability. This study also included a control task that asked subjects to order a picture sequence on the basis of physical causality, in which children with autism performed at a normal level, indicating that their impairment in understanding beliefs as psychological causes of behavior was not a result of a general inability to understand causality.
A similar finding was also reported in another study (Perner, Frith, Leslie, & Leekam, 1989) in which subjects were shown a Smarties box and asked to guess what was inside. When subjects were shown that in fact pencils (rather than the expected Smarties) were inside, they were then asked to predict what the next child who comes in would guess is in the box. Typically developing children answered “Smarties,” their original false belief. In answering this way, typically developing individuals clearly were able to inhibit their current belief in order to represent the counterfactual knowledge that the next child would have. The majority of children with autism, however, answered “pencils,” reflecting an inability to inhibit their own current beliefs and infer false beliefs in others. These findings have been interpreted as support for a selective deficit in understanding the psychological mechanisms that underlie human behavior.
It is important to note, however, that a debate exists over whether the deficits in these tasks are a result of impaired TOM or simply a deficit in executive functioning (see Perner & Lang, 2000, for a review of this debate). Though there is much evidence supporting the correlation between TOM abilities and executive function abilities in both typically developing individuals (see Russell, Mauthner, Sharpe, & Tidswell, 1991) and children with autism (see Ozonoff, Pennington, & Rogers, 1991; Russell, 1997), it appears that TOM abilities are a prerequisite for executive functioning rather then vice versa (Perner & Lang, 2000). Additionally, studies conducted by Charman and Baron-Cohen (1995) showed no deficit in individuals with autism on tasks that have a similar working memory load as false-belief tasks (e.g., false photograph and false model tasks), indicating that though a working memory or executive functioning deficit may exist in autism, it cannot account for the poor performance on these falsebelief tasks.
One prominent theory of the social deficits in ASD was put forth by Baron-Cohen et al. (2000), who implicated the amygdala as the core brain region responsible for this impairment. This theory was based on several lines of evidence. The first was primate lesion studies, which found that lesions of the amygdala resulted in monkeys that failed to initiate social interactions and failed to respond appropriately to social gestures (Kling & Brothers, 1992).
Other evidence comes from post-mortem studies finding increased cell density in the amygdala of individuals with autism (Bauman & Kemper, 1994). Functional imaging also showed significant reductions in activity of the amygdala during a mentalizing task (BaronCohen et al., 1999). Additionally, there is physiological evidence supporting a dysfunction in limbic connections resulting in an abnormal pattern of skin conductance response to visual stimuli in individuals with ASD (Hirstein, Iversen, & Ramachandran, 2001).
Though Baron-Cohen et al. stressed the role of the amygdala in autism, they were quick to highlight that other neural regions also show abnormalities.
Another brain region thought to play a role in the social deficits of autism is the medial prefrontal cortex (paracingulate cortex). This region responds during TOM tasks in typically developing individuals when subjects are asked to reflect on both their own and another individual’s mental state. (Brunet et al., 2000; Castelli, Happe´, Frith, & Frith, 2000; Fletcher et al., 1995; Gallagher et al., 2000; Vogeley et al., 2001) The same region also has reduced activity during similar tasks in individuals with ASD (Baron-Cohen et al., 1999; Castelli, Frith, Happe´, & Frith, 2002; Happe´ et al., 1996).
The third region that has been implicated in the social deficits in ASD is the superior temporal sulcus. Nonhuman primate single unit studies (Oram & Perrett, 1994) as well as human neuroimaging studies (Bonda et al., 1996; Grossman et al., 2000) have shown activity in this region in response to biological actions (see Allison, Puce, & McCarthy, 2000, for a review), as well as detection of eye gaze in monkeys (Perrett et al., 1985) and humans (Hoffman & Haxby, 2000; Puce et al., 1998) and inferred intentional action of inanimate shapes on the basis of movement patterns in humans (Castelli et al., 2000). This brain region has also shown abnormal activity patterns in individuals with ASD during face recognition tasks (Critchley et al., 2000; Schultz et al., 2000), a mentalizing task (Castelli et al., 2002), and an eye gaze-processing task (Pelphrey et al., 2005). Studies have also found reduced grey matter volume in anatomical MRI scans (McAlonan et al., 2004).
In conclusion, though more research needs to be done, there is much evidence that multiple brain regions including the amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and superior temporal sulcus are involved both in the development of normal social cognition and in the impairments seen in ASD. Additionally, each of these three regions appears to possess mirror properties. Thus the simulation theory of autism not only is supported by these findings but also subsumes these findings under a more unified theory.
Language Evidence for Role of Simulation in Language Comprehension and Production Thus far this review has discussed evidence for the role of simulation in three social abilities that are central in the behavioral ROLE OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM IN ASD 319 pathology of autism: understanding of others’ behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. We now move to address a fourth ability that can also be explained in terms of a deficit in simulation, language comprehension and production.
A leading theory of language comprehension may provide a clue as to why individuals with autism have both social and communicative deficits. This theory, termed the motor theory of speech perception (Liberman & Mattingly, 1985) has two main claims.
The first claim is that the objects of speech perception are not the acoustic signals (as proposed by Ohala, 1996) but rather the phonetic gestures. The phonetic gestures of the speaker are represented in the brain of the observer as motor commands that signal movements of the mouth, lips, and tongue in specific configurations. The second claim of this theory is that speech perception and speech production are intimately linked.
Supporting evidence for this theory comes from behavioral, neuromagnetic, and neuroimaging studies. One paradigm that has been used to support the linkage between speech perception and speech production is similar to the response interference paradigms used to support the role of simulation in action perception.
In a series of studies performed by Kerzel and Bekkering (2000), participants were asked to speak the syllables /ba/ and /da/ while watching silent videos of others articulating the same or different syllables. For both the /ba/ and /da/ conditions, a significant interference effect was noted with a slower reaction time when the response-irrelevant visual stimulus was inconsistent with the target response.
Additional evidence comes from neuromagnetic studies. Fadiga, Craighero, Buccino, and Rizzolatti (2002) performed a TMS study in which participants listened to auditory speech and nonspeech sounds while a magnetic pulse was applied to their left motor cortex. The MEP in the tongue was recorded using electrodes placed on the surface of the tongue. When tongue movements were required to produce the heard speech sounds, there was an increase in MEPs as compared with nonspeech sounds or speech sounds that did not require the tongue.
In a similar study, Watkins, Strafella, and Paus (2003) investigated whether hearing or watching speech sounds being produced would increase MEPs in the lips. Subjects listened to speech and nonverbal sounds and watched speech-related lip movements as well as eye and brow movements. In both the auditory and visual speech conditions, TMS over primary motor cortex resulted in an increase in MEPs in the lip muscles, further supporting the involvement of the motor cortex in the comprehension of speech.
fMRI studies have also shown specific activation of speech production areas during the listening of speech sounds. Wilson, Saygin, Sereno, and Iacoboni (2004) scanned 10 subjects while they listened to meaningless monosyllable sounds then produced the same sounds. Production of the sounds activated areas of prefrontal cortex including Brodmann’s areas 4a, 6, and 4p. Similarly, listening to speech sounds activated areas of ventral premotor cortex, which largely overlapped with the posterior speech production areas.
Although not directly related to the motor theory of speech perception, further evidence for the involvement of motor actions on language is found in the studies of Rauscher, Krauss, and Chen (1996) and Glenberg and Kaschak (2002). Rauscher et al. found that subjects gesture five times as frequently when describing spatial aspects of a visual scene as compared with nonspatial aspects (0.5 vs. 0.1 gestures per word). Additionally, when subjects were prevented from gesturing, they spoke more slowly. This finding applied only when the content of speech was spatial in nature (116 vs. 100 words per minute). With other kinds of content, however, the subjects’ rate of speech was somewhat increased when they could not gesture. This study provides evidence for a shared representation between verbal and motor aspects of language.
A series of studies conducted by Glenberg and Kaschak (2002) found that gestures may share not only a representation with language production but also language comprehension. In these studies, participants were asked to judge whether sentences were sensible by making a response that required moving either toward or away from their bodies. The experimental sentences were specifically created to describe actions that required movements either toward or away from the body (e.g., Open the drawer). When the response required a movement that was inconsistent with the sentence, the latency for response was increased as compared with when the response action matched the action described in the sentence. This finding was true for imperative (e.g., Open the drawer), concrete transfer (e.g., Courtney handed you the book), and abstract transfer (e.g., You told Liz the story) sentences.
Findings from this and the previous behavioral studies indicate that speech observation interferes with speech production, physical gesturing influences speech production, and language comprehension has a Stroop-like interference effect on action production, all of which support the motor theory of speech perception.
The second claim of the motor theory of speech perception is that speech perception and speech production share an underlying mechanism. Along these lines, recent evidence suggests that the superior temporal sulcus as well as the inferior frontal gyrus respond to both the sight and sound of human speech (Calvert & Campbell, 2003). Given these findings, researchers are beginning to draw connections from the action-related MNS to the utilization of this system for communication. If the purpose of simulating the action with mirror neurons is to understand the observed action, one would theorize that activating the speech production areas while listening to language would lead to better understanding of the verbalization. Electrophysiological and imaging data support this theory.
Hauk and Pulvermuller (2004) recorded EEG while subjects silently read words that related to hand, leg, and head actions. A visual-evoked potential was recorded over the frontal-central leads at approximately 210 –230 ms after stimulus onset. Source localization discovered that not only did the reading of these sentences activate regions of sensorimotor cortex, but the activation was somatotopically distinct based on the effector that would be used to perform the action. Face-action words resulted in activations in left frontal regions, whereas leg-action words showed activations in central leads, and arm-action words activated largely right central and right frontal regions.
A follow-up study by the same group (Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermuller, 2004) used fMRI to confirm that simple reading of action-related words activates somatotopically distinct areas depending on the effector used for that action. Results confirmed that reading face-action words specifically activated inferior frontal gyrus, arm-action words activated areas of middle frontal and precentral gyrus, and leg-action words activated pre- and postcentral gyri, superior frontal gyrus, and the dorsomedial frontal region.
320 OBERMAN AND RAMACHANDRAN For the arm- and leg-movement words, there was a significant overlap with performed leg and arm actions. For face-action words, the activation pattern was just anterior to the region activated by actual tongue actions. This study further confirmed the important relationship between action-related language and the areas of cortex responsible for the performance of the same actions.
A second fMRI study conducted by Tettamanti et al. (2005) confirmed that across all body parts, processing of action sentences selectively activated the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area). Mouth sentences activated the pars opercularis in regions rostral, dorsal, and ventral from the focus activated by all body parts. Additionally, the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal cortex was activated during listening of mouth sentences.
Hand sentences resulted in a distinctly different pattern of activation, including left precentral gyrus, the left posterior intraparietal sulcus, the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, the left insula, and the right middle temporal gyrus. Finally, leg sentences selectively activated the left dorsal premotor cortex (within the superior frontal sulcus) and the left inferior parietal lobule.
Finally, a TMS study conducted by Buccino et al. (2005) found a decrease in MEPs recorded from the hand muscles when participants listened to hand-action sentences and MEPs recorded from leg muscles when listening to leg-action sentences. Though modulations in MEPs were an expected result, the direction of the modulation was not as predicted. The authors suggested multiple explanations for the unexpected decrease in MEPs in the muscle consistent with the heard sentence including the modality of presentation and interference. Independent of the direction of the effect, this study provides evidence for specific modulation of the motor areas involved in action production when listening to sentences related to those actions.
Taken together, these findings support a shared mechanism for speech production and speech perception in both auditory and visual domains. Additionally, these findings support a role for simulation in speech comprehension, as the motor effectors involved in actions seem to be modulated when one listens to action-related sentences. The MNS was specifically implicated in the evolution of language in a review article by Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998).
Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998) suggested that the MNS, which mediated action comprehension in monkeys and higher primates, went through six stages of evolution that led to its eventual role in language comprehension in the modern human.
1. The MNS may originally have been for the purpose of recognition of grasping actions through a simulation mechanism in early primates.
2. This primal system evolved in the chimpanzee to support simple imitation for object-directed grasping.
3. In the early homonid, this simple system may have become elaborated to include complex imitation that allowed for learning of novel actions that could be approximated by variants of actions that were already part of the observer’s repertoire.
4. The early hominid then developed a system of protosigns, which was a manual-based communication system.
This leap from imitation for the sake of instrumental goals to imitation for the sake of communication was likely when the specificity of MNS for object-directed actions was lost.
5. Once protosign had evolved, this provided the scaffold for which protospeech could develop. Once an individual learned a conventional gesture, that gesture could be paired with a vocalization (protospeech).
6. The final stage, language, it is argued, was mediated more by cultural rather than biological evolution in Homo sapiens.
If, as suggested by Rizzolatti and Arbib’s model and the previously cited studies, the MNS and simulation processes are necessary for the proper evolution, development, and comprehension of language, then it is not at all surprising that individuals with autism, in addition to having social deficits, have language impairments.
Language Deficits in ASD Beyond the basic function of speech, language also serves the purpose of communication of thoughts, beliefs, and desires between individuals. Though about half of individuals with autism will acquire some level of linguistic knowledge, even these individuals will likely have a specific deficit in the use of language for social communication, pragmatic abilities. When compared with both typically developing and other developmental disorder populations, multiple behavioral studies have revealed a relative sparing of phonological, lexical–semantic, and grammatical aspects of language in verbal individuals with ASD (see Tager-Flusberg, 2000, for a review). The spared abilities may explain why many individuals with autism develop rudimentary aspects of communication, including turn-taking skills, requesting behavior, and regulatory speech.
Some clinical features of the language impairment in autism include echolalia, neologisms, and reversal of pronouns. In lower functioning individuals, often the only language production that is present is echolalic, or the echoing of the words phrases or sentences spoken by others (McEvoy, Loveland, & Landry, 1988).
Neologisms are idiosyncratic lexical terms that have special or unique meanings to the individual but no meaning to the general public. This tendency is most common in higher functioning individuals with ASD (Volden & Lord, 1991). Finally, verbal individuals with autism will commonly reverse pronouns and refer to themselves as you and others as I, indicating a difficulty in the notion of self and other (Lee, Hobson, & Chiat, 1994). This tendency is more common in individuals with autism than in any other clinical population (Lee et al., 1994). All of these features characterize the basic impairment in pragmatic use of language in individuals with ASD.
Some have suggested that this selective impairment may be tied to these same individuals’ TOM deficits (Locke, 1994; Sperber & Wilson, 1987; Tager-Flusberg, 1993). In the words of Sperber and Wilson (1987), “Communication exploits the well-known ability of humans to attribute intentions to each other” (p. 699). However, explaining the language deficits in autism in terms of behavioral ROLE OF THE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM IN ASD 321 TOM deficits without suggesting a candidate mechanism for either is explaining one enigma with another and adds little to the understanding of either of these phenomena. Additionally, the direction of this relationship is unclear. Some suggest that TOM is a necessary precursor to developing social communication (Winner, Brownell, Happe´, Blum, & Pincus, 1998;Winner & Leekam, 1991; Happe´, 1993); others have proposed that experience with social communication leads to proficient TOM skills (Peterson & Siegal, 2000).
Other theories for the language impairment in autism include the weak central coherence theory (Frith, 1989) and an executive dysfunction theory proposed by Liss et al. (2001). The central coherence theory states that pragmatic language requires the ability to not simply attend to the specific semantics of language but rather focus on the global context of the intercourse to comprehend the meaning, whereas the executive dysfunction theory is supported by correlational analyses between executive functioning and language skills in autism (Liss et al., 2001).
Though there is much theory on the underlying mechanisms mediating the language impairment in autism, there is little conclusive evidence for a causal relationship between TOM, central coherence, or executive functioning and the language impairment in ASD. However, the theory presented here, based on the motor theory of speech perception and theories suggesting the involvement of simulation mechanisms such as the MNS in language, provides a functional mechanism that may explain the communication impairments in ASD from a simulation account. One study, conducted in our laboratory, provides preliminary evidence for the role of impairment in the MNS in the language deficits of ASD (Ramachandran & Oberman, 2006). This study used a linguistic multisensory-integration task, the bouba– kiki task, in which participants are asked to name nonsense shapes. For example, if given an amoeboid shape and a jagged shape and asked to name one bouba and another kiki, 99% of the general population will name the amoeboid shape bouba and the jagged shape kiki. This is presumably because of mirror neuron-like multisensory systems that integrate the visual shape with sounds (sound–form symbolism). Surprisingly, only 20% of individuals with autism showed this effect. We suggest that the MNS may be involved in multisensory integration in the linguistic domain including the bouba– kiki effect and metaphors, which would explain their deficits in both tasks.
Conclusions This article has argued that perceptual recognition, motor mimicry, TOM, empathy, and pragmatic language may all be mediated by underlying simulation mechanisms in typically developing individuals. Despite this underlying similarity, historically these abilities have been studied in isolation, and consequently, multiple simulation theories have been developed to explain one or two of these phenomena. However, given that these abilities all seem to be impaired in a single clinical syndrome—autism—it is not only parsimonious but also clinically necessary to develop a unified theory.
Returning to Barsalou’s (1999) situated conceptualization model introduced at the beginning of this review, he proposed that simulators exist in multiple brain regions related to the region that first encoded that information. Thus, simulations of actions and body states may occur in areas of the cerebellum, superior temporal cortex, and the MNSs of inferior parietal lobule and premotor cortex (Miall, 2003), whereas the simulator networks for introspective states such as thoughts, beliefs, and emotions are likely to be found in the amygdala, medial areas of prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex.
Not coincidently, the brain regions that have most often been implicated in ASD— cerebellum, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and premotor cortex—all appear (on the basis of the literature cited in this review) to house simulator systems. Thus, we propose that a developmental impairment of functional simulators, especially the MNS, may be the unifying mechanism that underlies the deficits in imitation, TOM, empathy, and pragmatic language. A recent review by Gallese (2006) suggested that a similar mechanism, what he calls intentional attunement, is at the root of ASD.
As the data currently stand, this theory has yet to account for behaviors related to restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities. However, it is one of the most comprehensive of any of the theories to date and, with more research, may too account for this aspect of the disorder. The mirror neuron–simulation theory of autism, for which the first experimental support came from preliminary studies conducted in our lab (Altschuler et al., 2000; Oberman et al., 2005), accounts for the wide range of behavioral and neurological deficits that are unique to autism and has the added advantage of fitting well within the literature regarding these abilities in the normal population.
One question that still remains is how simulation systems such as the MNS develop. There are a variety of ways this unique mechanism could be set up, but whatever the mechanism, the research reviewed here suggests that a flaw in its initial setup might be the fundamental deficit in autism. This flaw could affect either the gray matter regions containing the simulator neurons themselves or the white matter tracts that link the regions together as a functional system or a combination of both.
As this review highlights, there is a large body of literature supporting the role of simulation in the areas of perception, motor mimicry, TOM, empathy, and language. Additionally, there is much evidence for deficits in these abilities in individuals with ASD. Two remaining questions that require further investigation include the development of the MNS and how well the behavioral deficits in ASD can be explained by impairments in simulation, especially in the domain of language in which this theory has yet to be applied. The latter is currently being investigated through studies using the same paradigms that were used to establish the importance of simulation in the general population to investigate whether their behavioral deficits are correlated with their performance on simulation tasks.
