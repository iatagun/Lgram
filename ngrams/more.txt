Abstract
There is a convergence between cognitive models of imitation, constructs derived from social psychology studies on mimicry and empathy, and recent empirical findings from the neurosciences. The ideomotor framework of human actions assumes a common representational
format for action and perception that facilitates imitation. Furthermore, the associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes
that experience-based Hebbian learning forms links between sensory
processing of the actions of others and motor plans. Social psychology studies have demonstrated that imitation and mimicry are pervasive, automatic, and facilitate empathy. Neuroscience investigations
have demonstrated physiological mechanisms of mirroring at single-cell
and neural-system levels that support the cognitive and social psychology constructs. Why were these neural mechanisms selected, and what
is their adaptive advantage? Neural mirroring solves the “problem of
other minds” (how we can access and understand the minds of others)
and makes intersubjectivity possible, thus facilitating social behavior.

INTRODUCTION
Although mimicry is a pervasive phenomenon
in the animal kingdom, imitation certainly
achieves its highest form in humans. Past
authors—for instance, de Montaigne (1575),
Adam Smith (1759), Poe (1982), Nietzsche
(1881), and Wittgenstein (1980)—have often
associated imitation with the ability to empathize and understand other minds. The evolutionary, functional, and neural mechanisms
linking imitation to empathy, however, have
been unclear for many years. Recently, there has
been a convergence between cognitive models of imitation, social psychology accounts of
its pervasiveness and its functional links with
empathy and liking, and the neuroscience discoveries of neural mechanisms of imitation
and empathy. This convergence creates a solid
framework in which theory and empirical data
reinforce each other.
Among cognitive models of imitation, the
ideomotor model and the associative sequence
learning model seem to map well onto neurophysiological mechanisms of imitation. The
ideomotor model assumes a common representational format for action and perception, whereas the associative sequence learning
model puts at center stage Hebbian learning as
a fundamental mechanism linking sensory representations of the actions of others to motor
plans. Furthermore, social psychology studies
have documented the automaticity of imitation
and mimicry in humans, a feature that also maps
well onto some recently disclosed neurophysiological bases of imitation.
This review discusses cognitive models, social psychology constructs, and neural mechanisms of imitation under the hypothesis that
these mechanisms were selected because they
offer the adaptive advantage of enabling the understanding of the feelings and mental states of
others, a cornerstone of social behavior.
COGNITIVE MECHANISMS
OF IMITATION
The Ideomotor Framework
of Imitation
Theories of action can be divided into two
main frameworks. The most dominant framework may be called the sensory-motor framework of action. It assumes that actions are initiated in response to external stimuli. In this
framework, perception and action have independent representational formats. Stimuli must
be translated into motor responses by stimulusresponse mapping mechanisms. This framework has generated a large literature and elegant experimental paradigms, as for instance
the work on stimulus-response compatibility
(Hommel & Prinz 1997, Proctor & Reeve
1990). Stimulus-response translational mechanisms, however, do not easily account for the
similarity between the observed action and the
action performed by the imitator that is required by imitation. Indeed, one of the main
problems of imitation often discussed in the
654 Iacoboni
Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2009.60:653-670. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org

literature inspired by sensory-motor models
is the so-called correspondence problem (Nehaniv & Dautenhahn 2002). This problem
can be summarized with the question: how is
the sensory input from somebody else’s action
transformed into a matching motor output by
the imitator?
For the ideomotor framework of action, the
correspondence problem of imitation is not a
problem at all. Indeed, the ideomotor framework assumes a common representational format for perception and action, an assumption that makes translational processes between
stimuli and responses rather unnecessary. The
roots of the ideomotor framework were established by the work of Hermann Martin Lotze
(Prinz 2005) and William James (1890). The
starting point of actions, for Lotze and James,
is not a response to a sensory stimulation, but
rather the representation of the goal that the
agent intends to achieve. When an intention
is unchallenged by a conflicting one, it activates the representation of the intended goal
and the motor plan necessary to achieve it. The
coactivation of the intended goal and the motor plan required to achieve it—according to
the ideomotor framework—is the result of our
experience. We have learned the effects of our
own actions, and we expect certain effects when
we perform certain acts. This previous learning
makes it possible that just thinking about the
intended goal automatically activates the representation of the action necessary to obtain it.
Thus, when I think about rebooting my computer, I automatically activate the representation of the finger movement necessary to press
the appropriate key.
The ideomotor framework naturally accounts for imitation. According to this framework, when I see somebody else’s actions and
their consequences, I activate the representations of my own actions that would produce
those consequences. Here, consequences are
construed in a very broad sense. For instance,
a simple finger lifting has multiple perceptual
consequences, among them the sight of the finger lifting. Thus, simply watching somebody
else lifting a finger should activate my own motor plan to lift the same finger. Brass and colleagues tested this hypothesis in elegantly simple experiments (Brass et al. 2000, 2001). Subjects were shown two movements of the index
finger from the same starting position. In half
of the trials the finger would move upward,
and in the other half it would move downward.
Subjects were instructed to respond as fast as
possible using their own index finger. Within
each block of trials, subjects were instructed to
use always the same motor response, either an
upward or a downward movement. Thus, although perceptually subjects were seeing both
upward and downward movements, motorically
they were only executing one of the two movements. Given that response selection was not
required, the identity of the stimulus was completely irrelevant for the initiation of the motor
response. Here, the sensory-motor framework
would predict similar reaction times for responses that were identical to the stimulus (e.g.,
upward motor response for a stimulus showing
an upward finger movement) and for responses
that were different from the stimulus (e.g., upward motor response for a stimulus showing a
downward finger movement). In contrast, the
ideomotor framework would predict faster reaction times for motor responses identical to
the stimulus compared to motor responses different from the stimulus. The results demonstrated a large chronometric advantage for responses identical to the stimuli, in line with the
predictions of the ideomotor framework (Brass
et al. 2000, 2001).
The ideomotor framework also predicts that
goals have higher priority than movements in
imitation. Imitation experiments in children
have confirmed this prediction. In one of these
experiments (Bekkering et al. 2000), children
and experimenters were sitting on the opposite
sides of a desk. In half of the trials the experimenter would place her or his left hand on the
left side of the desk (left ipsilateral movement)
or on the right side of the desk (left contralateral
movement); in the remaining half of the trials
the experimenter would place her or his right
hand on the right side of the desk (right ipsilateral movement) or on the left side of the desk

Associative sequence
learning: imitation is
based on associative,
Hebbian-like learning,
creating “vertical
links” between sensory
and motor
representations
(right contralateral movement). Children were
instructed to “Do what I do,” and in all cases,
they imitated all these movements well. In a separate session, children and experimenters were
again sitting on the opposite sides of the desk.
Now, however, there were two big red dots, one
on the left and one on the right side of the desk.
Whenever the experimenter made a movement,
either ipsilateral or contralateral with either the
left or the right hand, the hand of the experimenter would end up covering the big red dot.
Children were again instructed to “Do what I
do.” In this situation, children imitated well the
ipsilateral movements but made frequent mistakes when trying to imitate the contralateral
movements. Note that these movements had
been imitated well in absence of the big red dot.
The presence of the big red dot had changed the
goal of the action to be imitated. Whereas in
the absence of the dot, the action itself was the
goal to be imitated, the presence of the dot had
changed the goal of the action in covering the
dot. Indeed, children made mistakes when imitating contralateral movements because they
used ipsilateral movements to cover the same
dot that had been covered by the experimenter.
In other words, children would copy the goal
but used a simpler movement to achieve this
goal (Bekkering et al. 2000).
One of the main assumptions of the ideomotor framework is that action and perception
share a common representational format. This
assumption fits well recent neuroscience discoveries, as discussed below. Another important assumption of the ideomotor framework
is that our perceptual and motor experience is
very important in shaping the functional aspects
of imitation. This assumption is also shared by
the associative sequence learning model (Heyes
2005), as described in the next section.
Associative Sequence Learning
The associative sequence learning model of imitation proposes that imitative abilities are based
on associations between the sensory and motor representation of actions. These associations would be mostly shaped by experience,
although a small number of these associations
may be innate. Several environmental situations
may favor the establishment of these associations between sensory and motor representation of actions, for instance, visually guided
actions, such as reaching and grasping, during
which we can observe our own arm and hand
reach and grasp for objects surrounding us.
Also, mirrors and other reflecting surfaces allow the observation of one’s own facial and body
movement as if they were performed by somebody else. Furthermore, early in human development, adults tend to imitate the baby (Nadel
2002), thus favoring the formation of the associations between sensory and motor representations of actions.
The basic assumption of the associative
sequence learning model is that imitation is
not based on dedicated functional (and neural)
mechanisms. General sensory and motor systems may implement imitative abilities through
mechanisms that are strongly reminiscent of
Hebbian learning. One of the corollaries of this
assumption is that imitation should not be confined to specific lineages. Indeed, although primates clearly show varying degrees of imitative abilities, birds (Akins et al. 2002) and dolphins (Herman 2002) also seem able to imitate. Thus, imitative behavior appears to be the
product of convergent evolution. If this is true,
then the hypothesis that imitation is mostly
shaped by experience—as assumed by the associative sequence learning model—is obviously
supported.
The role of experience and the environment
in shaping imitative abilities may also account
for evidence that at first sight seems at odds
with the basic assumptions of the associative
sequence learning model. Many animals share
similar basic sensory and motor functional and
neural mechanisms. In principle, this should
lead to similar imitative skills in many animals. Imitation abilities, however, vary substantially between species (Boysen & Himes 1999,
Hurley & Chater 2005). Is this evidence a fatal blow to the main assumption of the associative sequence learning model? Probably not.
Indeed, different kinds of environments may
656 Iacoboni
Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2009.60:653-670. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org
by University of Sydney on 04/04/13. For personal use only.
account for the differences in imitative abilities observed in different species. As discussed
above, some elements that are quite specific to
the human environment should favor the formation of the associations between sensory and
motor representations posited by the associative sequence learning model. In keeping with
these ideas, humans are by far the best imitators
(Hurley & Chater 2005).
Empirical evidence in well-controlled laboratory experiments seems to support the role
of experience in shaping imitation, as hypothesized by the associative sequence learning
model. For instance, hand-opening and handclosing gestures are typically facilitated by the
observation of the same movement compared to
the observation of a different movement. However, this facilitation can be abolished by a relatively short period of training during which
subjects are instructed to open the hand while
observing hand closing, and to close the hand
while observing hand opening (Heyes et al.
2005).
In another experiment, the effect of training was measured on the speed of imitation
induced by the observation of human motion
versus robotic motion. A typical finding is that
humans imitate more quickly the movements of
another human compared to the movements of
a robot. This effect, however, may be simply because humans tend to interact more with other
humans than with robots. Indeed, subjects who
were trained to execute hand movement in response to a robotic movement demonstrated no
difference in speed of imitation while observing human and robotic movements (Press et al.
2007).
Although the associative sequence learning
model and the ideomotor framework of imitation share the main idea that experience is extremely important for imitation, they also seem
to differ on an important point. The associative
sequence learning model assumes that separate
sensory and motor representations are linked by
experience. In contrast, the ideomotor framework assumes that sensory and motor functional mechanisms share a common representational format. In psychological terms, these
differences are not negligible. The translation
of these different concepts into neural activity,
however, as discussed below, may not differ dramatically (Glimcher 2005). Indeed, the main
assumptions of both the associative sequence
learning model and the ideomotor framework
of imitation fit well with recent neuroscience
findings on imitation.
IMITATION AND EMPATHY
IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
Pervasiveness and Automaticity
of Human Imitation
Humans seem to have a strong tendency to align
their behavior with their fellows during social
interactions (Lieberman 2007). Some of these
forms of imitation and mimicry are not only
pervasive and automatic, but also operate on
a quite complex level. Ap Dijksterius (2005)—
following LeDoux’s terminology on processing
of fearful stimuli (LeDoux 1996)—suggests that
there are two roads to human imitation. A low
road leads to imitation in a direct fashion, such
that the perceiver acts the gestures, postures, facial expressions, and speech perceived in other
people. A high road leads to complex and rather
subtle forms of imitation, as shown by a number of experiments with priming manipulations that lead to stereotype activation or trait
activation.
An example of stereotype activation on
motor behavior is provided by the following experiment. Participants performed a
scrambled-sentence language task. Some subjects were exposed to words such as Florida,
bingo, gray; that is, words typically associated
with the elderly. Some other subjects were not.
After the experiment, participants left the laboratory and walked back to the elevator to leave
the building. An experimenter timed this walk
back to the elevator. Subjects who had been
primed with the elderly stereotype were reliably slower than subjects who had not been
primed (Bargh et al. 1996). The primed subjects

imitated—obviously in an unconscious way—
the slowness of old people.
The high road to imitation is also at work
in memory and general knowledge tasks. In
one experiment, subjects sat in front of a desk
full of objects. The stereotype of the elderly
was primed again in some subjects by asking
them questions on elderly people. Other subjects, in contrast, were asked questions about
college students. Subsequently, subjects were
transferred to another room and were asked to
remember the objects that were on the desk in
front of them. The subjects primed with the
elderly stereotype remembered far fewer objects than did the other participants (Dijksterhuis et al. 2000).
In a series of experiments, participants were
either asked to think about college professors
(a group of people typically associated with intelligence) and to write down everything that
came to mind about college professors, or they
were asked to think about soccer hooligans
(a group of people typically not associated with
intelligence) and to write down everything that
came to mind about soccer hooligans. In a
later task involving general knowledge questions, a task that was ostensibly unrelated to
the first one, the participants who were asked
to think about college professors outperformed
the participants who were asked to think about
soccer hooligans. Indeed, the participants who
were asked to think about college professors
even outperformed participants who were not
asked anything at all, and the participants who
were asked to think about soccer hooligans
were outperformed by participants who were
not asked anything at all (Dijksterhuis & van
Knippenberg 1998).
Many more studies support the concept that
the high road to imitation is pervasive and automatic (Dijksterhuis 2005). The question is why
pervasiveness and automaticity have been selected as distinctive properties of the high road
to imitation. One possibility is that imitation facilitates social interactions, increases connectedness and liking, gets people closer to each
other, and fosters mutual care. If this account
is correct, it should follow that good imitators should also be good at recognizing emotions in other people, which in turn may lead
to greater empathy. Thus, this account would
predict a correlation between the tendency to
imitate others and the ability to empathize with
them. This hypothesis was tested in a series of
experiments (Chartrand & Bargh 1999). In the
first experiment, subjects were asked to choose
pictures in a set of photographs. The cover
story was that the researchers needed some
of these pictures for a psychological test and
wanted to know from the subjects which pictures they considered more stimulating. While
subjects were choosing the pictures, a confederate was sitting in the same room with the real
subject. The confederate pretended to be another subject who was also choosing good stimulating pictures. During the experimental sessions, some confederates deliberately rubbed
their nose while the others shook their foot.
Subjects were videotaped and their motor behavior was measured. It was found that the real
subjects unintentionally mimicked the motor
behavior of the confederate with whom they
were sharing the room. Subjects who shared
the room with confederates who rubbed their
nose, rubbed their nose more than did subjects
who shared the room with confederates who
shook their foot. Furthermore, subjects who
shared the room with confederates who shook
their foot, shook their foot more than did subjects who shared the room with confederates
who rubbed their nose. These results are in line
with the idea that imitation is automatic and
provide the necessary prelude to the following
experiments.
The second experiment tested the hypothesis that one of the functions of this automatic
tendency to imitate is to increase liking between
individuals. Participants were again asked to
choose pictures, and confederates were again
sitting with them, pretending to be participants
of the study. In this second experiment, the
cover task required participants and confederates to take turns in describing what they saw
in various photos. At the end of the interaction
658 Iacoboni

by University of Sydney on 04/04/13. For personal use only.
between participants and confederates, the participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire to report how much they liked the
other participant (that is, the confederate) and
how smoothly they thought the interaction had
gone. In this second experiment, the confederates either imitated the spontaneous postures,
movements, and mannerisms of the subjects or
kept a neutral posture. The participants who
were mimicked by confederates during the interaction liked the confederates much more
than did the participants who were not imitated. Furthermore, mimicked subjects rated
the smoothness of the interaction higher than
did the participants who were not imitated.
This experiment demonstrated that imitation
and liking tend to go together. When someone is imitating us, we tend to like him or her
more.
A third experiment tested the hypothesis
that the more people tend to imitate others, the
more they are concerned with the feelings of
other people. The setting of this third experiment was identical to the first experiment. The
novel aspect of this last experiment was that the
participants responded to a questionnaire that
measured their empathic tendencies. The experiment found a strong correlation between
the tendency to empathize and the amount of
imitative behavior displayed by the participants.
The more a subject imitated the confederate,
the more that subject was an empathic individual (Chartrand & Bargh 1999). This result suggests that through imitation and mimicry, we
are able to feel what other people feel. By being
able to feel what other people feel, we are also
able to respond compassionately to other people’s emotional states (Eisenberg 2000, Tangney
et al. 2007).
Many other empirical results are consistent with these ideas (Braten 2007, Niedenthal
et al. 2005). What are the neural correlates of
these complex forms of human behavior? A recent discovery in the monkey premotor cortex
has sparked a whole series of new studies, in
monkeys and humans, that are relevant to this
question.

NEURAL MECHANISMS
OF IMITATION
Neural Precursors
in Nonhuman Primates
The premotor cortex of the macaque brain,
a cortical region important for the planning, preparation, and selection of movements
and coordinated actions, is not homogeneous
(Matelli et al. 1985). It is composed of several
cito-architectonic fields with different physiological properties. In the lateral wall of the
macaque brain, the ventral sector of the premotor cortex is composed of two main fields, area
F4 and area F5 (Matelli et al. 1985). Area F5 has
physiological properties relevant to the neural
control of mouth and hand movements, especially grasping (Rizzolatti et al. 1988). Within
area F5, there are neurons that discharge not
only when the monkey performs goal-oriented
actions such as grasping an object, holding it,
manipulating it, and bringing it to the mouth,
but also when the monkey, completely still, simply observes somebody else performing these
actions. Because of these properties, which almost suggest that the monkey is observing its
own actions reflected by a mirror, these cells
were called mirror neurons (di Pellegrino et al.
1992, Gallese et al. 1996).
The properties of mirror neurons call to
mind the concepts of the ideomotor framework of actions, according to which perception
and action share common representational formats. Indeed, mirror neurons embody the overlap between perception and action predicted
by the ideomotor framework by discharging
both during action execution and during action
observation.
The initial hypothesis about the functional
role of mirror neurons focused on action recognition. By firing during actions of the self and
of other individuals, mirror neurons may provide a remarkably simple neural mechanism for
recognizing the actions of others. Early observations on firing-rate changes in mirror neurons demonstrated that these cells do not fire at
the sight of a pantomime (Rizzolatti et al. 1996,
www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons 659
Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2009.60:653-670. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org

Strictly congruent
mirror neurons:
mirror neurons that
fire during the
observation of exactly
the same action they
code motorically
Broadly congruent
mirror neurons:
mirror neurons that
fire during the
observation of an
action achieving the
same goal or logically
related to the action
they code motorically
Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998). For instance, the pantomime of whole-hand grasp (when the whole
hand is used to grasp a relatively large object,
as an orange) does not trigger the discharge of
a mirror neuron that fires during execution and
observation of whole-hand grasps. This makes
sense because monkeys typically do not pantomime. These early findings suggested that the
properties of this neural system were remarkable but relatively simple, some sort of “monkey
see, monkey do” neural mechanisms. However,
many other findings contradict this view and
rather suggest that mirror neurons form a sophisticated, nuanced system for shared coding
of motor and perceptual aspects of actions of
self and others (Rizzolatti & Craighero 2004).
For instance, although the term “mirror”
implies a strong similarity between the executed
and the observed actions, only one third of
mirror neurons—the so-called strictly congruent mirror neurons—fire for the same executed
and observed action. The remaining two-thirds
of mirror neurons—the so-called broadly congruent mirror neurons—fire for executed and
observed actions that are not the same but either achieve the same goal or are logically related (di Pellegrino et al. 1992, Gallese et al.
1996, Rizzolatti & Craighero 2004), thus forming some sort of sequence of acts, as for instance
observed placing food on the table and executed
grasping food and bringing it to the mouth.
The properties of broadly congruent mirror
neurons suggest that these cells provide a flexible coding of actions of self and others. This
flexibility is an important property for successful social interactions because even though imitation is a pervasive phenomenon in humans,
people do not imitate each other all the time
but rather often perform coordinated, cooperative, complementary actions. Broadly congruent mirror neurons seem ideal cells to support
cooperative behavior among people (NewmanNorlund et al. 2007).
Following the initial observations (di Pellegrino et al. 1992, Gallese et al. 1996), a series
of more recent experiments have demonstrated
other complex properties of mirror neurons.
For instance, we often easily recognize actions
that are partially occluded. The role of mirror
neurons in the recognition of hidden actions
was tested by using a screen that occluded the
completion of the grasping action (Umilta et al. `
2001). In two baseline conditions, the firing of
the cells was measured for observation of grasping and of grasp pantomime. As expected, mirror neurons fired for grasping observation but
not for observation of the pantomime. In a new
experimental condition, the subject watched a
graspable object placed on a desk in front of
the monkey. Subsequently, a screen occluded
the sight of the graspable object and a human
experimenter reached with her or his hand behind the screen. The monkey was able to see the
experimenter’s hand moving toward the object
but was not able to see the actual grasping action, which was occluded by the screen. Approximately half of the mirror neurons tested in this
experiment discharged even though the grasping action was occluded. The firing rate changes
of these neurons were tested also in an additional control condition. Here, at the beginning
of the trial, the monkey saw that there was no
graspable object on the table. As in the previous
experimental conditions, a screen subsequently
occluded the sight of the table and a human experimenter reached with her or his hand behind
the screen. Consider that at this point, this additional control condition is visually identical to
the previous experimental conditions involving
the screen occluding the sight of the grasping
action. The only difference here is the prior
knowledge of the absence of a graspable object
behind the screen. Mirror neurons tested under this experimental condition did not change
their firing rate, suggesting that the unseen action behind the screen was indeed coded as a
pantomime (or, better, as a nongrasping action)
(Umilta et al. 2001). `
The experiment on hidden actions demonstrates another aspect of the properties of
mirror neurons that suggests that these cells
code actions in a fairly sophisticated way. The
same visual information is coded differently,
on the basis of prior knowledge about the
presence or absence of a graspable object
behind the screen. A subsequent experiment
660 Iacoboni

demonstrated that mirror neurons also code
in absence of any visual input (Kohler et al.
2002). In this study, after the necessary baseline
conditions were performed and mirror neurons
were identified, the experimenters measured
the firing-rate changes of mirror neurons to
the sound of actions. The sound stimuli used
in this study were associated with common
actions such as tearing a piece of paper,
breaking peanuts, and so on. Control sounds
not associated with actions, for instance white
noise, were also used (Keysers et al. 2003,
Kohler et al. 2002). The single-cell recordings
demonstrated that mirror neurons can also
discharge to the sound of an action, even in
absence of the visual input related to the action.
These auditory properties of mirror neurons
have two important theoretical implications.
One implication is relevant to the evolution of
language. Area F5 of the macaque brain (where
mirror neurons were originally discovered) is
the anatomical homologue of Brodmann area
44 of the human brain (Rizzolatti & Arbib
1998), a brain area with important language
properties. This anatomical correspondence,
together with other considerations, led to
the hypothesis that mirror neurons may have
facilitated the emergence of language in
the human brain (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998).
However, language is not only written and
read but also (and mostly) spoken and heard.
Mirror neuron responses to auditory stimuli
are essential evidence for the hypothesis that
mirror neurons are important neural elements
in language evolution. The other implication
of the auditory properties of mirror neurons
is that they show that mirror neurons are
multimodal cells. This functional property is
theoretically important because it is compatible
with associative models of how mirror neurons
may be formed, which is discussed in more detail below. When we break a peanut, the visual
input of our fingers breaking the peanut and
the auditory input of the sound of breaking the
peanut almost always co-occur, especially when
we are initially learning to perform the action.
Associative models can easily account for
multimodal responses that are produced by the
co-occurrence of sensory stimuli from multiple
modalities (Fanselow & Poulos 2005, Keysers
& Perrett 2004, Wasserman & Miller 1997).
A recent study on mirror neuron responses
to the sight of actions involving the use of tools
is also consistent with the hypothesis that the
properties of mirror neurons are shaped by experience. Early observations on mirror neuron
responses to observed actions suggested that
these cells do not fire at the sight of an action involving the use of a tool. For instance,
a mirror neuron discharging during the execution and observation of precision grips (when
grasping small objects with two fingers) would
not fire at the sight of the experimenter using a hand tool such as a pliers to grasp the
same small object (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998).
However, a recent study recording in the inferolateral aspect of area F5 has reported robust
discharges in approximately 20% of recorded
mirror neurons when the monkey observed the
experimenters using tools (Ferrari et al. 2005).
Indeed, these discharges were even more robust than the discharges of the same cells during the observation of a grasping action without the tool (Ferrari et al. 2005). Although it is
not possible to demonstrate unequivocally that
the mirror neuron responses to tool use actions
were acquired through the daily experience of
observing human experimenters using tools in
the lab, this seems a likely explanation. It is unlikely that tool-use mirror neurons were already
present in area F5 of the macaque brain but
never recorded for more than ten years. This
recently discovered functional property of mirror neurons and its likely underlying forming
mechanisms is also obviously relevant to the
psychological theories discussed above.
Furthermore, described above, the ideomotor framework of action puts intentions front
and center. Is it possible that the discharge of
mirror neurons may represent the coding of the
intention associated with the performed and
observed action rather than the action itself?
A recent single-cell recording study has addressed this question (Fogassi et al. 2005). The
depth electrode recordings first demonstrated
that neurons in area PF/PFG—a cortical

area located in the anterior part of the inferior parietal lobule that is anatomically connected with area F5 in the ventral premotor
cortex (seeFigure 1) and that also contains mirror neurons—had differential discharges for the
same grasping action that led to, say, eating food
rather than placing the food in a container (note
that the monkeys were rewarded after placing
the food in the container; thus, the amount of
reward was identical for both actions). Not surprisingly, grasping for eating was preferred by
the majority of grasping cells in this parietal
area, although approximately 25% of neurons
coding differently the same grasping action on
the basis of its intention preferred grasping for
placing over grasping for eating (Fogassi et al.
2005).
This pattern of firing-rate changes demonstrates that these cells code the same executed
grasping action rather differently, according to
the intention (or the goal) associated with the
grasping action. The same pattern of firingrate changes was also observed during action
observation. Here, the monkey was simply observing the human experimenter performing
grasping actions. The intention of the experimenter was cued by the presence of a container.
When the container was present, the experimenter grasped the food and placed it in the
container. When the container was absent, the
experimenter grasped the food and ate it. At the
time of grasping, the cells that discharged more
robustly for grasping to eat when the monkey
performed the actions also discharged more robustly when the monkey simply observed the
human experimenter grasping the food in order to eat it. Likewise, the cells that discharged
more robustly for grasping to place when the
monkey performed the actions also discharged
more robustly when the monkey simply observed the human experimenter grasping the
food in order to place it in the container (Fogassi et al. 2005). Thus, rather than coding the
observed grasping action, these neurons seem
to be coding the goal associated with the action, the intention to eat or to place.
The most dramatic demonstration of the
role of goal coding in these cells has been provided by a very recent study (Umilta et al. 2008). `
Here, single-cell recordings in area F5 were
performed after monkeys were trained to use
pliers to grasp objects. Ventral premotor neurons active during grasping actions were also
active when the monkey used pliers to grasp
objects. Monkeys were trained to use reverse
pliers that required hand opening rather than
hand closing (as in natural grasps). Remarkably,
neurons that fired during hand closing in natural grasps and during use of normal pliers did
fire during hand opening when the monkeys
used the reverse pliers. The activity of these
motor neurons is evidently centered on coding the goal of the action rather than the motor detail of hand closing or opening. Among
these motor neurons, the cells with mirroring
properties also demonstrated a pattern of firingrate changes centered on goal coding, discharging when the tips of the pliers were closing on
the objects to be grasped during observation
of action with both normal and reverse pliers
(Umilta et al. 2008). `
Mirror neurons do not mirror only grasping
actions performed with the hand or with tools
controlled by the hand. There is evidence of
mirror neurons coding facial actions, in particular with the mouth. Both ingestive (such as biting and sucking) and communicative actions are
coded by mirror neurons (Ferrari et al. 2003).
This is especially important for the hypothesis
that mirror neurons may facilitate our understanding of the emotions of other people, because the face is the body part that we use most
often to express our own emotions.
Macaque Mirror Neurons
and Imitation in Monkeys
Do monkeys imitate? This is a contentious issue, and the answer to this question is heavily dependent on the definition of imitation.
Among scholars, it was widely held at the end
of the nineteenth century that monkeys not
only are able to imitate, but they actually do
it “... at ludicrous length.” (Romanes 1883).
In those times, imitation was not typically associated with high forms of intelligence. This

view of imitation has changed considerably in
the past 30 years (Hurley & Chater 2005), calling also for a revision of previously held ideas
on monkeys’ ability to imitate. Indeed, such
revision had at some point taken the form of
a true backlash, with many scholars denying
that monkeys had any imitative ability. This
position raised the issue of what is the adaptive advantage of mirror neurons for monkeys
and inspired new and better-controlled studies. There is now well-controlled evidence that
monkeys are indeed able to imitate (Ferrari et al.
2006; Subiaul et al. 2004; Voelkl & Huber 2000,
2007), and it is likely—although there is no direct evidence yet—that this ability is supported
by mirror neurons. For instance, marmosets observed a demonstrator removing the lids from
a series of plastic canisters to obtain a mealworm. Subsequently, marmosets that observed
a demonstrator using its hands to remove the
lids used only their hands, whereas marmosets
that observed a demonstrator using its mouth
used their mouth to remove the lids (Voelkl
& Huber 2000). In another study, marmosets
observed another marmoset (the model) that
was previously trained to open a box in a peculiar way. Detailed motion analyses demonstrated that the highly unusual movement pattern of the model was faithfully replicated by
the observers (Voelkl & Huber 2007). A recent
study has also shown that rhesus macaques display neonatal imitation abilities that are similar to the abilities displayed by human neonates
(Ferrari et al. 2006).
It is evident, however, that imitative learning
is not developed in monkeys as it is in humans
(Hurley & Chater 2005). What then would be
the main function of mirror neurons in the
monkey brain? One possibility might be that
mirror neurons facilitate the ability to recognize the actions of others. A recent behavioral
study, however, has also revealed that monkeys
are able to recognize when they are being imitated (Paukner et al. 2005). In this study, monkeys observed two experimenters, each manipulating a wooden cube with a hole in each side.
Initially, the monkeys did not show any preferential looking between the two experimenters.
TMS: transcranial
magnetic stimulation
BOLD: bloodoxygenation-level
dependent
fMRI: functional
magnetic resonance
imaging
Subsequently, a cube was given to the monkey. When the monkey started manipulating
the cube, one of the two experimenters imitated accurately the monkey’s actions directed
at the cube. The second experimenter, in contrast, performed different actions. At this point,
the monkey preferentially looked at the experimenter imitating her own actions. This capacity, which is likely supported by mirror neurons, may have an important social function and
may be one of the early functional precursors
of the highly developed imitative behavior of
humans.
Human Brain Mechanisms
of Mirroring
The exquisite spatial and temporal resolution afforded by depth electrode recordings of
single-cell activity can be obtained only with
techniques of brain investigation that are quite
invasive. These techniques cannot typically be
used in humans. The neural properties revealed by single-unit recordings in monkeys are
usually investigated in humans at the system
level, with lesion studies (behavioral observations on neurological patients), brain imaging,
and recently transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS). Although the relationships between all
these markers of brain activity are far from being fully defined, there is evidence that they
tend to correlate relatively well. Spiking neuronal activity recorded with in-depth electrodes
correlates well with the blood-oxygenationlevel dependent (BOLD) signal measured by
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
(Logothetis et al. 2001). In some cases, however, spiking activity and BOLD seem to dissociate (Logothetis & Wandell 2004), for instance
when spiking responses show adaptation (that
is, a reduced response to repeated stimuli) while
BOLD does not (Goense & Logothetis 2008).
Nevertheless, a recent TMS study has shown
similar stimulation effects on both neural and
hemodynamic signals (Allen et al. 2007), supporting the practice of inferring neural activity
from signals based on hemodynamic changes,
such as BOLD fMRI.

Pars opercularis:

inferior frontal gyrus
delimited superiorly
by the inferior frontal
sulcus, inferiorly by
the Sylvian fissure,

ascending branch of
the Sylvian fissure.
Pars opercularis in the
left hemisphere is
classically considered
the posterior part of
Broca’s area, a major
language area of the
human brain
Indeed, this practice is widely used in systems neuroscience. For instance, single-cell
recordings with depth electrodes have revealed
in the dorsal premotor cortex of macaques cellular mechanisms of conditional motor learning, the fundamental ability that allows the
association of motor responses to arbitrary sensory stimuli, as when we brake at a red traffic
light. In humans, the dorsal premotor cortex
has also been associated with conditional motor learning by brain imaging and lesion studies (Passingham 1993). Even though single-cell
recordings of human dorsal premotor neurons
have not been performed, the obvious assumption is that the human brain must have dorsal premotor cellular mechanisms that enable
conditional motor learning and that are likely
similar to—albeit probably more sophisticated
than—the ones recorded in monkeys.
This very same logic applies to the investigation of mirror neurons in the human brain.
Given that the information typically obtained in
human studies is at system level, the term “mirror neuron system” is often used in these studies. Two positron emission tomography studies
(Grafton et al. 1996, Rizzolatti et al. 1996) and
a TMS study (Fadiga et al. 1995) provided early
evidence compatible with the idea that the human ventral premotor and inferior frontal cortex had mirroring properties. However, these
studies did not investigate the role of these human brain areas in imitation. In a later fMRI
study (Iacoboni et al. 1999), subjects were required to imitate simple finger movements and
to perform motor and visual control tasks. The
logic of the study was as follows: The neuronal
discharge measured by depth electrode recordings in macaques during action observation is
approximately 50% of the discharge measured
during action execution (Gallese et al. 1996).
Thus, human brain areas with mirror neurons
should also have an increased BOLD signal
(which roughly correlates with brain activity in
fMRI) during action observation that is approximately 50% of the BOLD increase measured
during action execution. Furthermore, during
imitation, subjects were simultaneously watching the finger movement and copying it. Thus,
mirror neuron areas may have a BOLD signal increase during imitation that is approximately the sum of the BOLD signal increases
observed during action observation and during action execution. The fMRI study found
that two cortical areas had this predicted pattern of activity: They were located in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus and in
the rostral part of the posterior parietal cortex (Iacoboni et al. 1999), in anatomical locations (Figure 2) that were homologous to the
anatomical locations of the macaque brain areas with mirror neurons, that is, area F5 in
the ventral premotor cortex and area PF/PFG
in the rostral sector of the inferior parietal
lobule.
The inferior frontal area with mirroring
properties overlapped with the posterior part
of Broca’s area, a major language area. On one
hand, these findings supported the evolutionary hypothesis about the role of mirror neurons in language (Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998).
On the other hand, an activation in a language
area during a nonlanguage task may be induced by covert verbalization occurring during
the activation tasks. It is unclear why imitation
should induce more covert verbalization than
motor execution, which in turn should induce
more covert verbalization than action observation (the pattern predicted for a mirror neuron
area and observed in the posterior part of the
inferior frontal gyrus and in the rostral part of
the posterior parietal cortex), and this issue cannot be conclusively resolved by fMRI, which is a
technique that provides only correlational data
between brain areas and human behavior. TMS,
on the other hand, provides information on the
causal role of the activity in a brain area and
human behavior. A high-frequency repetitive
TMS study indeed demonstrated later that activity in the pars opercularis, the posterior part
of the inferior frontal gyrus, is essential to imitation (Heiser et al. 2003).
A series of brain-imaging studies has suggested a core cortical circuitry for imitation
composed of the posterior part of the superior

temporal sulcus, a higher-order visual area that
responds to watching biological motion and
intentional actions (Allison et al. 2000, Jellema
et al. 2000, Perrett et al. 1989, Puce & Perrett
2003, Puce et al. 1998), and by the parietal
and frontal mirror neuron areas. Within this
cortical circuitry, the superior temporal cortex
would provide a higher-order visual description
of the actions of other people and would feed
this information to the fronto-parietal mirror
neuron areas (Iacoboni et al. 2001). The parietal mirror neuron area would code the motor aspect of the action (Iacoboni et al. 1999),
whereas the frontal mirror neuron area would
be more concerned with the goal of the action
(Iacoboni 2005, Iacoboni et al. 2005, Iacoboni
& Dapretto 2006, Koski et al. 2002).
Imitative behavior can take many forms
(Hurley & Chater 2005). The core circuitry for
imitation, composed of superior temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal
cortex, interacts with other neural systems to
support different forms of imitative behavior.
For instance, the interactions between the core
circuitry for imitation and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seem critical during imitative
learning (Buccino et al. 2004). In contrast, social mirroring and the ability to empathize with
others may be supported by the interactions between the core circuitry for imitation and the
limbic system (Iacoboni 2005). An fMRI study
of imitation and observation of facial emotional
expressions (Carr et al. 2003) tested the hypothesis that empathy is enabled by a large-scale
neural network composed of the mirror neuron system, the limbic system, and the insula
connecting these two neural systems. Within
this network, mirror neurons would support the
simulation of the facial expressions observed in
other people, which in turn would trigger activity in limbic areas, thus producing in the observer the emotion that other people are feeling.
This model predicts activation of mirror neuron areas, insula, and limbic areas during both
observation and imitation of facial emotional
expressions. Furthermore, the model predicts
that the increased activity in mirror neuron areas during imitation should also spread to insula
and limbic areas, if these brain centers are indeed functionally connected with mirror neuron areas. Both predictions were supported by
the empirical findings (Carr et al. 2003).
In functional terms, the large-scale network composed of mirror neuron areas, insula, and the limbic system likely provides a
simulation-based form of empathy (Goldman
2006, Goldman & Sripada 2005). Recent data
also suggest that the activity in this network
provides a biomarker of sociality and empathy. Indeed, an fMRI study of imitation and
observation of facial expressions in children
with autism and in typically developing children demonstrated not only a deficit in mirror neuron areas in the children with autism,
but also a correlation between the severity of
the disease and activity in these areas: The
lower the activity in mirror neuron areas, the
more severe the autism (Dapretto et al. 2006).
Furthermore, a separate fMRI study on typically developing preadolescents—in which the
activation task was again the observation and
imitation of facial emotional expressions—has
recently demonstrated that activity in mirror
neuron areas was positively correlated with interpersonal competence and empathic concern
(Pfeifer et al. 2008). Two additional fMRI studies on adults also support the findings obtained
in children. In one study, subjects observed simple grasping actions (Kaplan & Iacoboni 2006).
In the other study, subjects listened to action
sounds (Gazzola et al. 2006). Both studies found
a positive correlation between empathy scores
and activity in premotor areas activated during action observation and while listening to
action sounds, thus likely containing mirror
neurons.
Neural Mirroring and Psychological
Theories of Imitation
The ideomotor model of imitation and the
associative sequence learning model share
many concepts but diverge on a fundamental one: The former assumes overlap between
www.annualreviews.org • Imitation, Empathy, and Mirror Neurons 665

perceptual and motor representations, whereas
the latter assumes that sensory and motor
representations are separated but functionally
connected through vertical links formed by associative learning. Both models also map well
onto the functional properties of mirror neurons and neural systems for mirroring. Do the
neuroscience findings on mirror neurons better support the assumptions of the ideomotor
model on perceptual and motor representations
or those of the associative sequence learning
model? It is difficult to answer this question
because the levels of description of psychological theories and those of neuroscience empirical
work are radically different.
The discharge of mirror neurons during action execution and action observation seems
to fulfill the main assumption of the ideomotor model, a common representational format for perception and action. Preliminary results on individual neuronal activity obtained
with depth electrode recordings in humans (R.
Mukamel, A. Ekstrom, J. Kaplan, M. Iacoboni
and I. Fried, unpublished observations) seem
also to support the ideomotor model. Using a
rare clinical opportunity, we recently recorded
single-cell activity in epileptic patients implanted for surgical evaluation. We found human neurons with mirror properties in the
frontal lobe as well as in the medial temporal
cortex. Although the discharge of these cells
during action execution and action observation
seems to imply a common representational format for perception and action implemented at
single cell level, it is also true that lesions in
the frontal lobe are more often associated with
motor deficits, and lesions in the medial temporal lobe are more often associated with perceptual deficits. Perception and action, which
are united at the level of single cells, seem to
be more easily separated at the system level.
In principle, the discharge during action execution and during action observation of frontal
and medial temporal neurons may represent in
neural terms the “vertical links” posited by the
associative sequence learning model between a
sensory unit (the medial temporal neuron) and
a motor unit (the frontal neuron) that fire together as a result of associative learning.
WHY NEURAL MIRRORING
AND IMITATION?
The fundamental Darwinian question is why
mirror neurons were selected by evolution.
What is the adaptive advantage of having these
neurons? The properties of these cells seem to
solve—or better, dis-solve—what is called the
“problem of other minds”: if one has access only
to one’s own mind, how can one possibly understand the minds of other people? How can
one possibly share one’s own mental states with
others, making intersubjectivity possible?
A classical solution to the problem of other
minds is the so-called argument from analogy.
The argument from analogy posits that we first
observe certain relations between our mental
states and our bodily states and then find an
analogy between our body and the body of other
people. If there is an analogy between our body
and the body of others, there may be also an
analogy between our mental states/bodily states
relations and those of other people. This way
of reasoning about the mental states of other
people seems too complex for something we
seem to accomplish so naturally, effortlessly,
and quickly. Mirror neurons, in contrast, provide a prereflective, automatic mechanism of
mirroring what is going on in the brain of
other people that seems more compatible with
our ability to understand others effortlessly and
with our tendency to imitate others automatically, as we have discussed in this review.
A further implication of the recent work on
the relationships between mirror neurons, imitation, and empathy is the consideration that
the evolutionary process made us wired for
empathy. This is a major revision of widely
held beliefs. Traditionally, our biology is considered the basis of self-serving individualism,
whereas our ideas and our social codes enable
us to rise above our neurobiological makeup.
The research on mirror neurons, imitation,
and empathy, in contrast, tells us that our

ability to empathize, a building block of our sociality (Adolphs 2009) and morality (de Waal
2008, Tangney et al. 2007), has been built “bottom up” from relatively simple mechanisms
of action production and perception (Iacoboni
2008).
